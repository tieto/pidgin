* conversation api {{{
	* need to handle: {{{
		* unnamed chats
		* chats with the same name as a buddy
			* this should be working now, but it needs to be kept in mind when (re-)designing
		* jabber Messages (one off messages vrs a conversation with a backlog)
		* multiple conversations with a single buddy (jabber, with thread tag)
		* bugs
	}}}
	* notes: {{{
		* (12:58:39) Robot101: user list always|auto|never
		* topic only where supported by the protocol
		* how do we log this? {{{
			* rlaager's (NEW) proposal: {{{
				* each conversation has 1 or more logs associated with it.
				* when someone joins, a new log is opened
					* file based loggers should try to use hard-links in a smart way
					  to avoid duplicating data on disk as much as possible...
					* this needs to be designed in such a way that a database logger
					  can handle it w/o duplication...
					* TO SOLVE THESE CONCERNS, a link and/or copy function callback
					  will likely need to be added

* buddy list {{{
	* we have not committed any gobjectification, so this is not a blocker for 2.0.0 until we do.
		* if we do, it is only a blocker to the extent that pidgin & finch need to run.  That is, we do not
		  *necessarily* have to gobjectifiy everything as long as we preserve functionality.
		* That being said, my understanding of the signals mess says that it is probly more work to
		  try to do this in stages than to start it or not start it.
	* This would require some sort of signal aggregation, as gobject signals are unique to the instance.
		* one way to do this would be to emit the signals from a non-descript buddy object.  this would
		  most closely mimic the current functionality
		* a second way would be to actually try to aggregate them in some way. I really don't know how
		  possible this is, but it would allow us to do things like set a pounce on everyone in a group
		  or define sounds on a per-group basis.
		* we could look at replacing the UI ops with signals/call backs
	* bugs
		* wrong buddy given priority
}}}
* status {{{
	* Error messages aren't particularly usable currently.  we need to be able to see the full text of
	  the error, and what account is in that error condition.
	* No way to see accounts not in the global state.
	* Easier access to saved states is needed.
}}}
* Privacy {{{
	* this is not a blocker for 2.0.0
	* Privacy sucks. it doesn't handle many of the protocols in a way that users understand. notably
	  msn, but also yahoo, jabber, and icq.
	* We want to sync to the server as much as possible, entirely local-only privacy is not an option
	  except on protocols like irc that have no server-side.
	* We want to be as consistent across protocols as possible.  this will require renaming things on
	  some protocols.
	* Bleeter suggests that we create a privacy.xml, remove privacy from blist.xml.  He suggests
	  that each protocol define certain capabilities & defaults, with accounts.xml holding exceptions
	  to the defaults.
}}}
* Perl {{{
	* Block for 2.0.0 or remove perl:
		* Extended testing and resolving the inevitable bugs remains.
		* Test each call to make sure it actually works
		* Make it work with G_MODULE_BIND_LOCAL
}}}
* Prefs {{{
	* on upgrade from 1.x, the timestamp preference often gets lost.
}}}
* system log {{{
	* The system log minimally should tell me what _I_ do in Pidgin.  It should (minimally) tell me about
	  my accounts and actions.  It should thus list
	  * Pidgin start and quit
	  * Account connection
	  * account disconnection, and reason if caused by error.
	  * account state changes, IFF we are logging that for buddies.
		* This might include the state message(s).
	  * This might be done using one or more files.
	* historically, the system log has also functioned to log things about buddies that do not relate
	  to a specific conversation.  While I(luke) do not at all object to this, it could be argued that
	  such functionality more properly belongs in a plugin, such as the buddy state notification plugin.
	  if we continue to implement such functionality, it could include:
	  * logging when a buddy signs on, including in some form what account sees that change.
	  * logging when a buddy signs off, including in some form what account sees that change.
	  * "		"	 " "	 goes idle, "		  "  "	  "    "    "       "    "    "
	  * "		"	 " "	 goes away, "		  "  "	  "    "    "       "    "    "
	  * "		"	 " "	 becomes available, " "    "  "    "    "       "    "    "
	  * like the logging of my own accounts, this could be done in one or more files.
	    * one potential downside of using multiple files is the idea that either the file's contents
		  duplicate information contained in the file's location/name, or that we need to manipulate
		  the display so as to convey that information to the user from the graphical viewer
