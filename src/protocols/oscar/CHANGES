No release numbers
------------------
 - Fri Jun 15 17:51:27 EDT 2001
  - Make faimtest compile on RH7.1 (new gcc).
  - Add aim_conn_getsess()
  - Add aim_getconn_type_all() and aim_getconn_fd().
  - Make aim_connrst() and aim_conn_getnext() static to conn.c.
  - Why does arcanejill think she is in EDT? Oh well.

 - Thu Jun 14 17:37:47 PDT 2001
  - Rearrange aim_setprofile().  It will now let you _not_ send a profile,
      if you really want to (pass NULL).  Note that this is quite different
      than sending a _blank_ profile.  Also fixes the "asci" bug.

 - Mon Jun  4 12:57:46 PDT 2001
  - Fix chatnav.  Whoops.

 - Mon Jun  4 12:45:18 PDT 2001
  - Don't use snacid's for generic requests (gets around recent blocks)
  - If they start doing snacid-based blocks again, an audit will have
      to be done to see what WinAIM requests uses snacids for and what 
      it leaves it blank for.  That will be tedious and I'm not going to 
      do it. 

 - Thu May 31 23:00:50 PDT 2001
  - Store two hardcoded hashes in login.c.  Sigh.
  - Add prototype for aim_callhandler_noparam in aim_internal.h

 - Sat May 26 03:58:27 PDT 2001
  - Aha! This is why I could never get icons to work before.
  - Luckily the checksum is painfully simple.

 - Sat May 26 01:37:39 PDT 2001
  - So this is my big merge with the ActiveBuddy version...
    - Remove use of tlvchains from IM parsing for better performance
    - Add in buddy icon support
    - Add support for sending UNICODE messages.
  - Split up the more complicated options to aim_send_im into a structure
      that is passed to aim_send_im_ext().  This makes it easier to send
      simple messages, and only slightly harder to send complex ones.
     - aim_send_im_ext() must be used if you're using buddy icons and/or you
         are sending UNICODE messages.
  - UNICODE is fully explained in commentary above aim_send_im_ext() in im.c.
  - The ISO-8859-1 option is also added.  Use when necessary, to avoid making
      WinAIM barf.
  - This removes the msglen parameter to aim_send_im because that was only
      needed to do UNICODE, which can now only be done by aim_send_im_ext.

 - Wed May 23 18:05:46 PDT 2001
  - I upgraded libtool.  Which broke the faimtest makefile.
  - Parse locate rights
  - You shouldn't ask so many questions, Eric.

 - Wed May 16 12:48:13 PDT 2001
  - Thanks Rob and Eric

 - Thu May 10 17:37:23 PDT 2001
  - I haven't had lunch yet.  What should I have?

 - Wed May  9 15:21:51 PDT 2001
  - I had pizza for lunch.

 - Mon May  7 15:19:55 PDT 2001
  - Rename rxhandler_t to aim_rxhandler_t.  This has been 
     bugging me for a while.

 - Thu May  3 15:47:23 PDT 2001
  - Clean up getcap/putcaps
  - Add GAMES2 and SENDBUDDYLIST caps (the latter is new in winaim 4.7beta)
  - Update hash to latest value

 - Wed Apr 25 11:51:39 PDT 2001
  - I think this was a bug.

 - Tue Apr 24 17:36:03 PDT 2001
  - Let Eric generate the hash if he wants.

 - Mon Apr 23 15:58:11 PDT 2001
  - On a clear day, you can see forever.

 - Thu Mar 29 13:05:50 PST 2001
  - Less leaks.

 - Thu Mar 29 14:45:22 CST 2001 (jbm)
  - Add module capability to the 0001/001f stuff (jbm)

 - Wed Mar 28 21:20:08 PST 2001
  - Add flags arg to aim_chat_send_im()
  - Add msglen arg to aim_send_im and aim_chat_send_im
     - This will make more sense when I make the UNICODE commit (tomorrow?)

 - Wed Mar 28 16:51:25 PST 2001
  - I decided it was a good day while I was figuring out that it was a bad day.
  - See faimtest and login.c::memrequest().
  - Hopefully I'm done for a while.

 - Tue Mar 27 19:15:10 PST 2001
  - I haven't decided yet whether today is a good day or a bad day.
  - Probably both.
  - More later.

 -  Mon Mar 26 16:08:45 PST 2001
  - Why didn't anyone tell me buddy-offgoing wasn't working?
    - *** REQUIRES CLIENT CHANGES... buddy-offgoing now passes a userinfo
          struct (its now identical to buddy-oncoming)

 - Mon Mar 26 15:57:41 PST 2001
  - Hrmph.
  - Debuglevel wasn't getting set properly by aim_session_init

 - Sat Mar 24 03:16:32 UTC 2001
  - vaargs to msgerror and locateerror swapped
     - ** CLIENT CHANGE: Reason code comes before SN now.  This is so that
          the backend code for all three error handlers is identical.
  - aim_getinfo() returns -1 on failure (hah! I don't think anyone checks 
      return codes from libfaim anyway...they're known for their
      inconsistency and lack of sensicality)
  - Remove _DEFAULT handlers in faimtest...
     - They were not consistent.
     - They did not make sense.
     - They did not work anyway.
     - Most of them were #if 0'd.
  - Add ICBM Parameter Info callback... you can catch this if you want.
  - aim_getbuildstring() now takes a buffer instead of returning static (ew!)
  - Clean up, "factorize", etc
  - More stuff... (Only one "middle handler" left in rxhandlers.c!)

 - Fri Mar 23 05:42:11 UTC 2001
  - Export aim_encode_password_md5()
  - Add middle handler for 000b/0002 (min report interval)
  - Add aim_session_kill()
     - CLIENTS MUST CALL THIS either in addition to or instead of
       aim_logoff(), particularly if you keep lots of sessions open.
       (Sessions now contain dynamically allocated memory which must be freed.)
  - Oh, and some other stuff...

 - Fri Mar 23 01:45:28 UTC 2001
  - Add AIM_CLIENTINFO_KNOWNGOOD
  - Fix a few details in aim_send_login (thanks temas)
  - Prevent aim_rxhandlers from being called recursively
     - This is something that has been in my PENDING_AIM mailbox for over
       a year now.  I figured it was trivial enough to throw in.  EveryBuddy
       wanted it, but I don't remember why.  It should never happen anyway.
  - Use AIM_CLIENTINFO_KNOWNGOOD
     - This lets faimtest log in after today's round of AOL being mean.

 - Fri Mar 16 23:12:58 UTC 2001
  - Remove one level from aim_rxdispatch()

 - Wed Mar 14 20:21:49 UTC 2001
  - Clean up declarations of TLV functions (ie, const)
  - Add -o and -O to faimtest (I didn't use your patch, josh)

 - Wed Mar 14 03:11:03 UTC 2001
  - Err...I'll commit before I go home.  More faimtest crap.

 - Tue Mar 13 20:23:04 UTC 2001
  - Fiddle with faimtest a bit.

 - Sun Mar 11 06:02:19 UTC 2001
  - Banish socklen_t.

 - Mon Mar  5 01:19:48 UTC 2001
  - Fix typo in last CHANGES entry.
  - Add fix from Eric to keep efence from complaining about malloc(0)
  - Add .cvsignore files (also from Eric)
  - Throw in josh's latest OFT/ODC kludges
  - Completly remove all calls to printf and (unbounded) sprintf
  - Add aim_setdebuggingcb()
  - Remove preprocessor-based debug semantics (faimconfig.h)
  - faimdprintf() now calls a user-specified callback to do printing
  - Rearrange aim_tx_new() parameters to be more sensical, add sess
  - Do some sanity checking in aim_tx_new()
  - Add #defines to keep printf from compiling inside libfaim
  - Who knows what else. (in total, this patch is nearly 5k lines)

 - Fri Mar  2 02:17:22 UTC 2001
  - Add aim_fingerprintclient(). (AB will trust this, but you shouldn't.)
  - Add some EXTRA_DIST to Makefile.am

 - Mon Feb 26 01:46:34 UTC 2001
  - Fix swapped bytes in aim_caps[]. Thanks to 
      Bruce Miller <bmiller@ics.uci.edu> for pointing this out.

 - Sun Feb 11 01:07:36 UTC 2001
  - Make secondary connections to the authorizer work again
  - Make aim_auth_changepasswd() work again.
  - Add aim_auth_setversions(), aim_auth_getinfo(), aim_auth_setemail(),
    aim_auth_reqconfirm()
  - Add middle handlers for responses to all of above.
  - Add examples of above to faimtest (start with 'reqauth')
 
 - Fri Feb  9 22:31:22 UTC 2001
  - Add aim_tx_setenqueue().

 - Thu Feb  8 20:12:39 UTC 2001
  - Let TLV functions out of aim.h if FAIM_NEED_TLV is defined.

 - Thu Feb  8 02:31:25 UTC 2001
  - Remove aim_purgecookies() -- never used anyway
  - Clean up a few bits of aim_msgcookie.c
  - Remove AIM_CONN_MAX constant (hasn't been relevent in ages)
  - Change commentary on synchro in aim.h
  - Add NOPLOCKS and make them default
  - Make faim/aim.h more of a mess; try to keep interfaces hiddenish.
  - Add #define FAIM_INTERNAL to top of every file
  - Remove aim_countconn (no one uses it anyway)
  - Add aim_cloneconn() (cringe.)
  - Throw in josh's getfile patch (and then munge it enough to break it)
  - Add getopt() to faimtest.
  - Remove aim_buildcode.h/mkbuildinfo.sh crap.
  - Clean up aim_cleansnacs()
  - There may have been other stuff too.  As always, the diff is the 
    most accurate changelog there is.
  - *** FT is currently more broken than it was before.  Also, this patch
    introduces even more memory leaks.  You've been warned.

 - Sun Dec 17 07:19:04 UTC 2000
  - Update the capability block list

 - Sat Dec 16 01:34:19 UTC 2000
  - Rename paramid to rateclass

  - Add a few other comments
  - Clean up aim_bos_clientready().

 - Fri Dec 15 23:35:01 UTC 2000
  - Add genericerr callback/middle. 
   - This is for catching the errors that come back, for instance, from
     sending a SNAC that isn't supported by the host (such as the
     Watcher Request SNAC).

 - Fri Dec 15 21:51:32 UTC 2000

  - Typos

 - Fri Dec 15 02:04:12 UTC 2000
  - Parse rate changes *properly*
  - Add sample code to faimtest demonstrating my approximations
      on how to fiddle with aim_conn_setlatency() in relation
      to the rate changes (properly wildly conservative). [I also
      copied this stuff into mfaim.]

 - Thu Dec 14 03:39:34 UTC 2000
  - Change the 0x01 to a 0x00 in auth request to make buddy lists work again
  - Rearrange bytes in setversions() to match winaim

  - Create aim_cachesnac()
  - Some long overdue cleanups

 - Wed Dec 13 00:38:56 UTC 2000
  - Added the client update/version info to the authresp callback
  - Added the prototype for aim_getfile_send_chunk to aim.h

 - Tue Dec 12 23:02:41 UTC 2000
  - Got pissed off at sess->logininfo.  Got rid of it.
    - Now pass all that stuff in as varargs, like it should be.
    - *** Look at the changes to faimtest. You'll also need to
          change anything in your code that references sess->logininfo
          to reference sess->sn instead.  The rest of the other info
          is now unavailable (it was before, too, it just didnt look like it).
  - A few other minor cleanups.
  - Added aim_gettlv8/16/32, aim_puttlv_8, and aim_addtlvtochain_noval.
  - Added that short 0x004a TLV to the auth request, like WinAIM 4.3.

 - Mon Dec  4 23:46:35 UTC 2000
  - Add exchange to the create response callback (doh!)

 - Sat Dec  2 02:14:45 UTC 2000
  - Dumb bug in aim_clearhandlers()

 - Fri Dec  1 23:48:38 UTC 2000
  - Store exchange along with room name in the great chat hack

 - Fri Dec  1 22:25:56 UTC 2000
  - Fix numerous tiny (but sometimes catastrophic) bugs dealing
      with connection death (particularly with chat connections)
  - *** Any connection with a -1 fd will get returned by aim_select
      immediatly now... your code probably already handles this implicitly.

 - Wed Nov 29 17:31:23 UTC 2000
  - Rewrote some of the msgcookie stuff
  - Changed cachecookies to uncachecookies where it makes sense (arg!)
  - Minor other stuff
 
 - Fri Nov 10 08:24:34 UTC 2000
  - Add sess->flags (replaces sess->snaclogin)
  - Remove odd setstatus call in chat parser
  - Remove aim_tx_enqueue macro, replace with a smarter one
    - If a connection is in progress, enqueue instead of calling
      the client-specified queuer
  - Add support for nonblocking connects through the 
     AIM_SESS_FLAG_NONBLOCKCONNECT flag to aim_session_init()
  - Add AIM_CB_SPECIAL_CONNCOMPLETE callback. Not real useful.
  - Add AIM_CB_SPECIAL_FLAPVER callback. Can be used as an alternate
     way of starting the login process, or just to look like you 
     know what you're doing. Fixed associated inconsistencies
     in aim_rxhandlers too.
  - Fix some connection status stupidities in faimtest.

 - Wed Nov  8 13:11:18 UTC 2000
  - Reenable/reimplement older login, but only use for ICQ UINs
    - This is a fairly ugly hack.  But...eh.  It works.
    - You'll need to remove the aim_sendconnack() before the
      call to aim_request_login.  It will now do it automatically
      if its needed.  (hint: ***CLIENT CHANGE***)

 - Wed Nov  8 02:23:25 UTC 2000
  - I'm trying out using a modified version of the kernel-doc scripts
     to help document the libfaim code a bit.  See aim_conn.c and 
     aim_tlv.c, as well as the scripts in utils/docs.

 - Wed Oct 25 17:52:20 UTC 2000
  - Cleanup warnings from newer gcc's (RH7.0)
    - Aparently newer gcc's don't let you do as strong of integer types
      on va_arg as older ones... So, let me know if this breaks on your
      compiler

 - Tue Oct 17 02:10:13 UTC 2000
  - Rearrange a few things

 - Mon Oct 16 20:56:59 UTC 2000
  - Remove some warnings

 - Mon Oct  9 04:24:56 CDT 2000 (jbm)
  - took care of the XXXs in aim_putuserinfo()
     - now use dynamic TLV count to send ("look ma, no magic!")
     - now send cap blocks
     - now send icq info if a numeric SN

 - Wed Oct  4 21:29:47 CDT 2000 (jbm)

  - Added an aim_tx_destroy(); need to move the lib over to using it.
  - Got rid of some #if 0 BS code in a couple of places 
      (aim_ft::establish() and aim_im::aim_parse_incoming_im_middle()).
  - Added some file transfer stuff (so experimental, i haven't 
      had a chance to see if it causes cancer in lab animals).
  - Added to faimtest for all of the above.
  - Added myself to AUTHORS with Real Info.

 - Thu Sep 21 00:24:36 UTC 2000
   - Add socks5 proxy support (not tested real well, worked the 
       few times a tried).
   - Added proxy support to faimtest.

 - Tue Sep 19 03:10:07 UTC 2000
   - Add aim_setuserinterests() and aim_setdirectoryinfo()
   - Add ICQ away status

 - Tue Sep  5 03:47:26 GMT 2000
   - More ANSIfication for win32
   - Forgot aim_misc last time.

 - Mon Sep  4 22:08:35 GMT 2000
   - Forgot aim_snac and aim_search

 - Mon Sep  4 21:38:09 GMT 2000
   - A mild step towards ANSI compliance
     - Compiles cleanly with -pedantic (except for the libc issue in socket.h)
     - Fixes various sign mismatch things. There may be more, we'll see
       what MSVC has to say about it.
   - Add faim_internal and faim_export macros so Win32 DLL is easier

 - Sun Sep  3 23:58:17 UTC 2000
   - Portability fixes (for solaris, set the SOLARIS env var first)

 - Sat Sep  2 23:42:37 UTC 2000
   - Hopefully fix aim_snac.c bugs
   - Add Buddy List Rights parser (max buddies and max watchers)
   - Fix rather major problem in rxhandlers caused by missing breaks
   - Add reason code for msgerr (0004/0001) callback
   - Add BOS Rights parser (max permit / max deny)

   - Add parser for missed calls (0004/000a)

 - Fri Sep  1 23:34:28 UTC 2000

     - Should fix the big message problem and the big buddy list problem
   - Changed some values around in aim_misc to match winaim4.1
   - Added aim_addicbmparm. dunno what it does
   - Cleanup the login process in faimtest (can now login in less than 2sec)

 - Fri Sep  1 00:13:04 UTC 2000
   - Avoid zero-length mallocs in aim_tlv

   - Clear out all that old login cruft. Much cleaner now.
   - REQUIRES CLIENT CHANGES (see faimtest)

 - Fri Aug 18 19:52:54 UTC 2000
   - Fix the non-pthread bug

 - Thu Aug 17 23:19:40 UTC 2000
   - A few more leak fixes (only a few left to go...)

 - Thu Aug 17 23:08:08 UTC 2000
   - More leak fixes (eric, eric, eric...)

 - Thu Aug 17 22:53:03 UTC 2000
   - Change the SNAC cache to a hash instead of list
   - Fixed a few leaks relating to aim_gettlv_str()

 - Tue Aug  8 04:25:35 UTC 2000
   - Preserve subtype and priv after aim_conn_close

 - Tue Aug  8 04:15:47 UTC 2000
   - Fixed double-calling of faim_mutex_init
   - conn->type preserved after aim_conn_close

 - Mon Jul 17 01:56:31 UTC 2000
   - Added 0004/000c callback (for message acknowledgments)
      - This goes with the AIM_IMFLAGS_ACK option that has been there
        for ages now.  When you send a message with that option, you'll
        get a message back containing the screenname, telling you it was sent.
   - Moved the aim_conn_kill's out of aim_get_command() and into
      the client.  They're only closed in there now.  This is so that you 
      can detect what type of connection died.  You'll want to handle
      BOS and chat connections in special ways most likely.  You'll also
      need to call aim_conn_kill when you're done with it.
   - Added/fixed the Rate Change handlers.  Now passes up a long that
      should contain a number.  I'm currently in pattern-searching mode.

 - Sun Jul 16 22:59:39 GMT 2000
   - Fixed the locking in the rendezvous code.  Hopefully is safe now.

 - Sun Jul 16 11:03:28 GMT 2000
   - Fixed 0001/000a chat printf.  (Actually a one liner a few days ago.)
   - Started integrating josh's 3k rendezvous patch.  Currently only
      directim is working.  And its got bugs.  But he's not online
      right now, so I can't bitch.  I'd love to bitch here, but I'm 
      tired. 
     - Can definitly accept directim connections and send/recieve.
     - See faimtest for the new callbacks.  (Urg.)
     - Here weeee gooooo.  (Not sure if this will break everyone or not.)

 - Fri Jun 30 00:04:47 UTC 2000
   - Removed the forceful ICQ-related warnings, just in case they're wrong
   - Added three new fields to the client info.  
      - **REQUIRES CLIENT CHANGES -- see faimtest for new initializer
   - Cleaned up aim_send_login()
   - Put in a nice hidious fix for AOL's latest bit of the drama.  See
      aim_readtlvchain() for the details.

 - Mon Jun 26 07:53:02 UTC 2000
   - Added utils/aimdebugd for playing with things -- see the README
   - Added aim_im.c::aim_parse_outgoing_im().  Probably not useful
      unless you're writing a server or something (or hacking aimdebugd).
   - aim_send_im() now sends the same data as AIM4 does (three more bytes)
   - Added aim_debugconn_sendconnect() for aimdebugd-enablement.

 - Sat Jun 24 02:14:07 UTC 2000
   - Added fakelocks for platforms without pthreads or that have no
      use for them.
   - Added workaround for MSG_WAITALL for people with the very broken
      libc that comes with earlier Red Hat's.

 - Sat Jun 24 00:44:24 UTC 2000
   - Support zero-type TLVs in aim_extractinfo()
     - AOL now ocassionally throws extra zeros in so in order to break
         clients.  Aparently zero-type TLVs are a special case -- if the
         type is zero, then _there is no length_ field.  AOL are geniuses.
     - Note that you only get these if you send a bad client string, such
         as the top one in faimtest.  If you #if 0 that one out and use the
         second one, you'll be fine.  (Unless you just want to see the message
         for yourself.  Its nifty. (FREE!))
   - ICBM parser now uses aim_extractuserinfo() so that it can benefit
       from the above changes, as well as clean up the whole "is it the 
       first or the second one of this type?" issue
     - This also fixes the changes AOL made in away messages.
   = Fixed a possible buffer overflow when AOL changes the max sn length
   - Increased MAXSNLEN to 32 (they appear to be valid)
     - If you start getting messages from someone called "AOL Instant
        Messenger", see comment one, paragraph two.
   - aim_select() now returns a -1 if there are no connections open
   - Connections are now killed completely if there is a major error on them
   - faimtest now calls aim_logoff() on connection error

 - Fri Jun 23 22:38:47 UTC 2000
   - Adds start of adverts support
   - Adds aim_bos_nop().  You may want to send this occassionally
   - Fixes aim_rxhandlers.c to work for people with three-letter
       screen names

 - The week prior to Fri Jun 16 19:37:09 UTC 2000
   - Rethought the rendezvous stuff.  DEFINIT WORK IN PROGRESS
     - Do not bother trying to use this.  This will probably break
         your clients.  You may or may not want to fix them, since 
         I may change it again soon.  
     - I REPEAT: This really is a developer-only version.  It barely
         compiles.  I'm just committing it so I don't have so many
         trees floating around.
   - Added stuff to support OFT as well as OSCAR protocols
   - Added aim_send_im_direct() for directim ("IM Image")
   - Added caps getting/putting routines 
   - Added more aim_login fixes to avoid more AOL stupidity
     - This is the same as went to libfaim-devel yesterday, so don't upgrade
       just to get these changes.
   - Removed aimicq_encode_password -- now use the same table
       for both ICQ and AIM
   - Added AUTHORS

 - Tue Jun  6 01:36:48 UTC 2000
   - Inverted gethostbyname2() check.  Not sure how that ended up 
       in that state.
   - Added some of the initial framework to support file transfers
   - Added in a few checks for that
     - Can currently parse and send a denial message.
   - Added cookie caching.  (Sorry, I just like saying that.)
   - Rearranged channel 2 ICBM parsing (detects the different
       rendezvous types better and hopefully accuratly).
   - Killed the connection array.  Now a list.  (Suits the
       upcoming features better.)  --- REQUIRES CLIENT CHANGES...
     - In most cases, you need to change aim_conn_close() calls
         to aim_conn_kill().  This will free them as well as 
         close them.  If you don't do this, you'll pollute the
         connection list and leak memory.
   - Possibly a few other minor things (some cleanups to faimtest for one)

 - Fri Jun  2 23:27:28 UTC 2000
   - Cleaned up aim_send_login slightly
   - Added aimicq_encode_password to support the new hash
       values required for logging in with ICQ
   - Removed crash when email and/or reg status aren't
       in the auth response (they're not in ICQ responses)
   - So now as long as you specify a client version of 
       4.30.3141 in the client info, and your ICQ number
       as your screen name, you can login to ICQ via libfaim
       and use it just like an AIM account.
   - Added AIM_CB_SPECIAL_CONNERR callback for recieving 
       messages such as disconnect reasonses ("you logged
       on from a different machine", etc).
   - Added faimtest's userinfo handler to support away messages

 - Fri Jun  2 15:57:27 UTC 2000
   - Add creation time, maxmsglen, and various unknowns to chat info
     update callback.
   - Remove 'nothing works yet' comment from top of aim_chat.c (it works!)

 - Wed May 31 01:17:24 UTC 2000
   - Added constants for message sizes (MAXMSGLEN, MAXCHATMSGLEN)
     - Note that the new max message size is defined as 7988bytes,
         drastically larger than WinAIM lets you put out.  This is a
         libfaim-exclusive feature :)
   - Reduced base buffer size on aim_send_im()  
 
 - Tue May 30 22:32:31 UTC 2000
   - Added lock around tx seqnum to prevent that race when transmitting
       from diverse threads. (actually committed earlier today)
   - Added aim_meta.c and a few constants and things to keep
       track of "releases".  
   - Added mkbuildinfo.sh to automatically update build string
       "constants" on every invocation of 'make all'.

 - Mon May 29 12:08:28 GMT 2000
   - Rearranged aim_tx_flushqueue(); moved write operation 
       to aim_tx_sendframe()
   - Turned aim_tx_enqueue() into a macro that calls sess->tx_enqueue,
       a function pointer to whatever you want to use to enqueue
       things for transmition (or not)
   - Old aim_tx_enqueue becomes aim_tx_enqueue__queuebased.  Added
       aim_tx_enqueue__immediate for doing immediate writes.  Default
       is to use queue-based procedure.
   - Cleaned up parts of aim_conn.c
   - Added locking around the sockets themselves.  Should allow
       for full cross-thread usage.
     - Unfortunatly, only pthreads are supported at this time.
       If you don't have pthreads on your arch, implement the
       macros your arch needs and send me a patch.  (A SysV
       semaphore implementation would be trivial, as would a 
       simple integer-based lock.)

 - Sun May 21 14:59:20 GMT 2000
   - Added infotype parameter to aim_getinfo() for requesting
       different types of messages.  AIM_GETINFO_GENERALINFO
       will get you the normal stuff, AIM_GETINFO_AWAYMESSAGE
       will get the normal stuff, with the profile replaced with
       the user's away message.  Also, the callback adds an 
       unsigned short to the end to give you the value that
       was originally passed to the request.
   - There were a few server-pertinent changes that didn't get 
       documented from last month.  I have no idea what they were.

 - Sun Apr  2 07:29:11 UTC 2000
   - Redid much of the tx path to remove the superfluous copy.  But
       it touches every function that transmits.  Its been a long 
       time in coming.
   - Added caps parameter to aim_bos_setprofile().  You can now
       control what capabilties you show up as others to
   - Added ->capabilities to userinfo.  It should be nonzero when
       its coming off buddy oncoming information, but NOT requested
       user info.

 - Sun Apr  2 01:45:15 UTC 2000
   - Increased AIM_CONN_MAX from 5 to 7.  Precausionary only
   - Removed deprecated TIS_TELNET_PROXY from faim/faimconfig.h
   - Added macros for the simple integer functions in aim_util.c
   - Removed usage of aim_failsaferead() 
      - Still not sure why I had it to begin with.  I think it 
        was a remament from when we used non-blocking sockets
        (which I don't know why I did either)
   - Removed some of the oddities in aim_get_command()
      - gprof showed this taking 20kns on my k6-300.  Should be faster now.
      - Added conn parameter.  This should prevent aim_select() from
        getting called too many times in a row.

 - Thu Mar 23 08:45:40 UTC 2000
   - Removed aim_countconn() > 0 check in aim_select(), its logically redundent
   - Added aim_putuserinfo() (inverse of aim_extractuserinfo())
   - Added aim_sendbuddyoncoming/offgoing() 
   - Rearranged loop in rxdispatch()
   - Remove aim_conn_close() if connections dead in aim_get_command()

 - Thu Mar 23 00:44:32 UTC 2000
   - Added a check to purge_rxqueue to skip handled commands

 - Mon Mar 20 05:30:59 UTC 2000
   - Added some server-only functions for login
   - Added aim_counttlvchain()
   - Added aim_sncmp() and aim_snlen()

 - Sun Mar 19 06:07:52 UTC 2000
   - Added a parameter to aim_select to return event type 
     - REQUIRES CLIENT CHANGES.
   - For the most part rewrote the tx and rx queuing code 
     - Should fix many, many outstanding problems in and related
         to that code, including one that keeps memory from freeing 
   - Fixed several bugs in various places
   - Reformated a lot of code, and did general cleanups
   - Should have a generally more robust lib now.

 - Sun Mar 12 00:07:40 UTC 2000
   - Fixed a robustness problem in aim_handleredirect_middle()
   - Added TLV chain creation routines (yes, aimd is progressing)

 - Mon Jan  3 04:07:55 UTC 2000
   - Fixed bug in aim_snac.c
   - Fixed condition where commands read from connections that have 
       been closed were still left in the queue.  Now cancelled.
   - Added some printfs to aim_info to get more informative crahes
   - Fixed a bug in aim_rxqueue::purge

 - Sun Jan  2 10:31:19 UTC 2000
   - Cleanups in aim_info.c
   - Can compile with -Ddebug=100 again
   - Implemented chat: Joining/Leaving, info parsing, IM parsing/sending
   - Implemented some chatnav: rights req/parsing, room creation

 - Thu Dec 30 10:08:42 UTC 1999
   - Fixed bug in aim_im.c when (encoding == NULL) || (lang == NULL)
   - Added detection of voice chat requests
   - Added AIM_CLASS_* defines, including new Away flag
   - Added awaymsg parameter to bos_setprofile.
     - If awaymsg is nonnull, you will be advertised as being away (your
         class will be ORed with AIM_CLASS_AWAY), otherwise you'll show 
         up normal.

 - Wed Dec 29 10:06:35 UTC 1999
   - Fixed small bug in IM parser
   - Added stubs for the capability TLVs in userinfo.

 - Wed Dec 29 09:14:45 UTC 1999
   - Added a capability block to aim_bos_setprofile.  Can now get chat 
       invites again.
   - Extended ICBM parser to support channel 2 messages (chat invites)
     - A channel parameter has been prepended to the varargs -- REQUIRES 
         CLIENT CHANGES.
     - Extended faimtest to support chat invites.
   - Changed faimtest to get sn/password from environment

 - Wed Dec 29 04:17:03 UTC 1999
   - Added -g to CFLAGS
   - Added aim_sendconnack() to aim_login.c (needed for newer login)
   - Added code for the new SNAC-based login/auth procedure. (see SNACLOGIN
       in faim/faimconfig.h for why its not enabled)
   - Reimplemented aim_authparse(), aim_handleredirect() using TLVlists
       - The old auth_failed callback is now integrated into the
           success one.  If there was an error, logininfo->errorcode is nonzero
   - Fiddled with version information.  Added aim_setversions()
   - Added table of SNAC names for showing unknown snacs (jbm)
   - Added a middle handler for MOTD
   - Added new authorization SNACs to faim/aim_cbtypes.h   

 - Sun Dec 26 22:59:10 UTC 1999
   - Renamed login_phase1_struct to aim_login_struct
   - Changed cookie and sn to be static arrays in aim_login_struct
   - Integrated the Jabber-faim changes.  (temas)  [BIG CLIENT CHANGES]
     - Added aim_session_t, removed all global variables
     - Changed all functions to accept a session pointer
     - Removed aim_global.c
     - Updated faimtest to use an aim_session_t.
     - Removed all cases where logininfo was passed as vararg to client
   - Fixed small bug in aim_newconn's 'fixing' of host:port addresses
   - Added an install rule to the makefile (installs headers+so only!)
   - Enabled USE_SNAC_FOR_IMS by default, assuming it got fixed
       by n's new aim_snac.c from ages ago
   - Implemented a middle handler for 0004/0001 message errors, added
       snacid lookup to get illfated destination SN and pass to client
   - Implemented a short middle handler for offgoing buddy.

 - Fri Dec 24 21:30:06 UTC 1999
   - Added an error-counting Read() that has been sitting in my inbox
   - Cleaned up header files, created aim_cbtypes.h.
   - Added void * to aim_conn_t for private client use if they want. (Orb)
   - Removed all stderr output.  All output is important, and goes to stdout.
   - Renamed isautoresponse in IM parser to icbmflags.
   - Added Orb's fix for the new login code, deleted old (see Orb, I do read
       your mail....eventually).
   - Added mailing lists to README.

 - Fri Dec 24 11:12:34 UTC 1999
   - Cleaned up both outgoing and incoming ICBM handling.  Anything
       that crashes around there is no longer libfaims fault!
       - The encoding flags are now passed up to the client.
   - Added several TLV routines to parse large blocks of continuous
       TLV triplets.  Not terribly effecient, but quite elegent in usage.
   - Added icbm_setparams() back in from way-back-long-ago.  It hasn't
       been implemented in a long time, but I think we should still send it.

 - Fri Dec 24 01:23:06 UTC 1999
   - Fixed a very minor bug in aim_newconn().
   - Added aimutil_get{16,32}()
   - Added aim_extractuserinfo() for extracting  user data
       blocks and putting them into struct aim_userinfo_s's.
         - Added a loop to print out info on extraneous TLVs.
         - Put in lots of comments.
   - Added parse_oncoming_middle() to parse the user data
       block of that packet.  Now passes struct aim_userinfo_s
       to client.
   - Rearranged parse_userinfo_middle().  Now passes an entire
       userinfo struct to client instead of individual variables.
   - Convered the version of parse_im_middle() thats actually getting
       used to pass up a userinfo struct.  
   - Updated faimtest to accept new structs.

 - Tue Dec 21 06:18:50 UTC 1999
   - Fixed a Win32 header problem
 - Tue Dec 21 03:44:13 UTC 1999
   - Latency timers now update on rx as well as tx.  Gets rid of even more
       of the rate problems that most clients are having.  
   - Renamed lasttx and settxlatency to lastactivity and setlatency, respec.
   - Integrated fixes needed for Win32 -- should compile cleanly now (DMP)
   - Cleaned up some places, use aim_putsnac everywhere now.

 - Sun Sep 26 20:04:20 MST 1999
   - Reduced the IM parsing to look for 3 zeros instead of 4 -- NEEDS WORK
       - This was needed to work with MacAIM3 and some WinAIM3s.
   - Added aim_conn_settxlatency() for throttling outgoing frames -- NEEDS WORK
   - Added an int to the userinfo and incoming IM user callbacks for new
       TLV that AOL put it in -- its the number of seconds elapsed since
       the user logged in
   - Worked more on the callbacks (more internal rearrangements)
   - Fixed bug in aim_select() (returning negative fds)
   - Clear out logininfo struct before putting more data into it
   - Other bugfixes that I can't particularly remember.

 - Tue Aug 24 03:13:12 UTC 1999   --- TRANSITION RELEASE!!
   - Added jbm's new aim_rxqueue.c, which should crash less
   - Started the overhaul on the callback system.  No where near complete yet.

       aim_send_im_away()
   - Added client_info parameter to aim_send_login()
   - Tweaked aim_send_im() (AOL changed a few things, there's some more
       changes left to do)
   - Some Chat stuff changed, still no where near functional
   - Finally remembered to switch the license to LGPL (from GPL)
   - Permit/Deny (blocking) list support added
   - Released a snapshot
