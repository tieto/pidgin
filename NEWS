-=[ Gaim ]=-  The Pimpin' Penguin IM Client That's Good For The Soul!

0.61 (04/07/2003):
	Rob: Nathan commited his news first.  However, I'm cooler so I'm putting
	my entry above his.  Yeah, so, there were some DnD issues with 0.60. I 
	blame it on the rain. It was falling, falling.  I blame it on the
	faucet. It drips all night.

	Sean: I committed my news after Rob.  I'm cooler than Nathan (by far) but
	not as cool as Rob.  So I go here.  Actually, I didn't do anything since 
	0.60 other than commit some other peoples patches.  The one from Dave Camp
	is cool.  How 'bout this snow?  Isn't that crazy?  Oh, and thanks to everyone
	who wished me a happy birthday.

	Nathan: You want frequent releases?  You got 'em ;-)  Chip wrote some
	cool new pounce stuff, and things shouldn't get weird when you drag
	groups and buddies around.  It's bad enough having 1 of some of my
	buddies on my list, I definitely don't need duplicates.  Being that I
	have class in the morning, I'll just raise my juice glass for this one.

0.60 (04/04/2003):
	Rob: Wow. So, it has been a really long time since we started the
	gtk2 fork. It's finally ready for public consumption. Sean is about
	to go out and buy a case of beer.  My roommate is downstairs right
	now pouring me a shot of his choice.  Everyone, raise your beers if
	you've got them.  It's been a cool almost 10-months of development.
	I hope you all enjoy. Drink'em if you got'em!

	Sean: I'm writing this 3 minutes before my 21st birthday.  Nobody can
	believe we're finally ready to relase 0.60.  Many thanks to everyone
	who helped out; I'm convinced that Gaim 0.60 is the best IM client to
	date (only to be bested by 0.61).  There's WAY too much stuff to mention.
	Even the ChangeLog is somewhat incomplete.  Yay, I'm 21 now!  Everyone
	enjoy! :)

	Nathan:  Happy birthday Sean!  Rob decided to let me start cleaning up
	after everyone, so here I am.  "sexy" is the only word that can be used
	to describe 0.60.  Prepare to be shocked and amazed.  /me raises his
	(shot) glass ;-)

	Christian: Geeeeeze this took a long time. Worth it though! Personally, I
	thought we'd all just give up on releases altogether and tell everybody
	just to grab CVS. I'm pretty happy with this release. I was able to
	contribute quite a bit to it. Makes me feel proud to be a gaim developer!
	I'm really looking forward to the future releases. I have some neat stuff
	planned. Yay, I'm still 19! Mmmm, Sierra Mist. Make me a sammich!

	Mark: Whoops, I started drinking a little earlier than I was supposed 
	to.  I guess I missed the memo.  Hmm, I ate at a restaurant somewhere, 
	I think it was at Snowshoe, and the menu had "sammiches" on it.  It was 
	pretty sweet.  I'd like to give a shout out to all the Gaim 
	devizelopers for rizocking the hizzy the past few months.  Word.


0.59 (06/24/2002):
	Rob: I guess Sean is busy at home or something and Jim is asleep.
	I'm very tired but it's time for a release.  Enjoy.  :)
	SORRY FOR THE DELAY. :(

	Sean: It's been a long time since our last release, and for no 
	good reason either.  Rob and I just haven't been able to get together 
	to do it.  But now we have.  Aside from some Jabber changes and some 
	crucial MSN fixes, most of this release's changes are transparent, 
	but none-the-less important.  Well get some better changes when my 
	computer works again, you have my word*

	*My word is worthless.


0.58 (05/13/2002):
	Rob: Yeah, so, my computer has been bad which is why the release
	didn't go out on time. Oh well.  I would like to welcome
	Jim Seymour aboard the development team.  He's going to be taking
	over the work on our Jabber code as well as doing various other
	nit picking. He likes to pick nits, nats, and umm, knots, I think.

	Sean: This release has a long ChangeLog.  Higlights include an
	important security fix for MSN and a few nice new features.
	Not *much* cooler than 0.57--but we're making progress ;)

	Jim: Hmmm... Rob said I have to say *something*, so here it is:
	Rob's a mango.

0.57 (04/25/2002):
	Rob: Not too much in this release, as Sean said below. (This is
	what happens when the bottom person goes first.) New translation,
	a few fixes, secure msn hotmail logins, blah blah blah. As Sean
	said, the next release will be cooler. If only you could read
	our minds ;-).

	Sean: Nothing too special here, but a critical Yahoo fix that
	ensures Yahoo! will work when they discontinue the old protocol
	all the other 3rd party clients are using.  Next release will be
	cooler, I promise.

0.56 (04/11/2002):
	Rob: Well, what do you know. I have another headache. I always have
	these damned headaches. I got pissed off with the way GtkTree looks.
	I wanted to move to using GtkCTree. I think they're pretty.
	Unfortunately, GtkCTree sucks. After a little digging through
	the code, I managed to molest GtkTree into looking like
	GtkCTree. Thanks to everyone that helped track down that one
	annoying style problem.

	Sean: Hello.  This is another minor release while Rob and I finish 
	up on some bigger projects.  We're reworking a lot of the UI to make 
	it easier to use, nicer looking, and more compatible with gtk2.  
	I've also been trying to bring the Yahoo plugin up to date, so it 
	will work for Indian users and avoid a potential problem in the near 
	future.

0.55 (03/29/2002):
	Rob: 0.55 is here. I've been away for a few days on business. Sean
	has been on Spring Break. Therefore, this release is mostly a patch
	release. It does fix some bugs and makes a few thing slightly cooler,
	so it's better in that aspect, I suppose.  Enjoy.

	Sean: This is mostly a bugfix release.  I'm on Spring Break, not
	doing any coding at all.  But lots of people sent in great patches
	anyway.  Thanks guys!

0.54 (03/14/2002):
	Rob: Well, here we are. 0.54. We got a lot of fun things in this
	release. Better working SSI, Image sending, protocol specific
	smiley faces, and a whole lot of triscuits. *gobble*

	Sean: We fixed a lot of bugs in this one, and probably introduced
	a bunch too. ;)  We were both really busy, and did all the coding
	late at night when we were tired, so if something isn't working, 
	it's probably just tired code.  Enjoy the triscuits!

0.53 (02/28/2002):
	Rob: Well, we missed yesterday's release. That's Okay, I head a
	nasty headache. You can all just deal. ;-)


	Sean: Neat Goodies!  Whee!!  Oscar got a lot of great additions.
	It can do Screen Name formatting, it can save and store your buddy
	list on the server, it can do typing notifications in Direct
	Connections, and yes, it can receive IM Images!  Sending images will
	be added in the next release.  MSN and Yahoo! can do typing 
	notification too.  Hooray!


0.52 (02/17/2002):
	Rob: Well, after a long delay we're finally ready for another release. 
	I finally got settled into my new apartment, the new job is going 
	well, and I finally have internet connectivity again. You can expect 
	us to be back on our usually bi-monthly schedule.  Enjoy these fixen, 
	as they resolve a few connectivity issues. :-)

	Sean: It looks like things are back on track now.  Eric left which is 
	sad.  He's done so much for Gaim, and I know we're all thankful.  
	Thanks Eric!  I'll be stepping in and do more development, but I can 
	never replace Eric.  This release fixes a long-standing problem in 
	MSN.  If you've gotten errors when trying to connect to MSN, you want 
	this release.  If you've suddenly found yourself unable to connect to 
	Yahoo!, you want this release too.  The "neat goodies" will be in the 
	next release ;)

	Rob: Operation Evil does not exist! ;-)


0.51 (01/24/2002):
	Rob: Well, here we go. I FINALLY got around to making a release
	after over a month, Sorry for the delay, all. Things got really
	hectic around the gaim house hold.  This release isn't as complete
	as I had hoped, but I promised to get something out. There's some
	neat goodies in mind for the next release, right Sean? :-)


0.50 (12/13/2001):
	Rob: I am tired. Tonight was weird. Bleh!!!!

	Eric: I second that.

0.49 (11/29/2001):
	Rob: *still mamboing*
	
	Whew! That was a bad little mambo.  I hope everyone had a nice
	little Holiday, if you celebrate. If not, then I hope you had
	a sucky weekend. :-D. 

	Oh, lots of cheese for everyone!! (Beware the duffle)

	It's getting cloudy. I think it's going to storm somethin'
	fierce. That's my southern talk. Do you like it? 

	Eric: I want to be like you.

	Do the cha cha cha!

0.48 (11/18/2001):
	Rob: Hi! It's 4:12am! I'm watching The Simpsons. :). 
	Oh boy, sleep! That's where I'm a viking! :) There's not
	too much for me to say in this release. I'd just like to
	thank Eric for his hard work. :)

	Eric: Everybody mambo!

0.47 (11/01/2001):
	Rob: Hi. Gaim v0.47 has been released, as you should already
	know. I hope all of you had a nice little halloween. There are
	quite a number of changes in this release. There are a few too
	many to list here, so I will redirect you to ye olde ChangeLog.

	Eric: Remember back in the day when TOC was the only protocol
	Gaim could use? Remember the login window from back then? Back
	before Gaim had perl or plugins or multiple connections or
	10 different protocols. Things have changed so much since then.
	Many more changes in this release as well. All good things.
	Don't forget to talk to SmarterChild.
	
0.46 (10/18/2001):
	Rob: Hey guys! The smores were great! I really enjoyed meeting
	up with all of you guys and singing campfire songs. It was 
	really awesome.  Thanks for the beer, too. Next time, it's on me.
	
	This release has quite the number of bug fixes. I won't bother
	going into detail here. Just ust it, love it, live it - SEGA!

	Eric: Lots of fixes. Things compile well now. ICQ has stopped
	crashing on PPC and Sparc. If you know someone who isn't using
	Gaim because it was unstable, please get them to try this
	version. It's much better, I promise.

0.45 (10/04/2001):
	Eric: Well, it seems that the time has come for yet another
	release. There are several yummy additions in this release, and
	quite a few useful bugfixes as well. Unfortunately it seems that
	Rob is currently unavailable; he joins us in spirit. He'll be
	joining us later for a group sing-along and smores by the
	campfire. But for now, you'll need to keep yourselves occupied
	with 0.45. And remember, a happy hacker is a pimpin' penguin.

0.44 (09/20/2001):
	Rob: Another release has come upon us. There were actually quite
	a number of things in ye old ChangeLog for this release. I don't
	feel like talking about them here, so you can read about them
	in ... you guessed it .. the ChangeLog.  Oh, and if you're 
	wondering about setting buddy icons, wait til 0.45 or 
	use CVS shortly after this release. ;-)

	Eric: You should all be using CVS anyway. This has become the
	slogan in our IRC room, #gaim on irc.openprojects.net. The IRC
	plugin got lots of updates (mostly because I felt bad about using
	X-Chat for IRC when gaim supposedly had an IRC plugin), so you
	should load the plugin and join us. :)

0.43 (09/06/2001):

	Rob: Well, I knew that the day would eventually come. I just didn't
	expect it to be so soon. ;-).  Yes, that's right, Eric and I finally
	got sick of all of the pre releases.  We didn't want to make this
	release an official 0.11.0. We thought that it would cause a lot
	of confusion. We didn't want to continue our trend of prereleases
	either. So, since gaim was first released officially, there
	have been 42 releases.  This is number 43, hence the 0.43 version
	number.  We're going to stick with this trend from now on. :-).

	Eric: We're also going to be starting a release early, release
	often trend, that hopefully we'll stick to this time. Hopefully
	we'll be putting out a new release every two weeks or so. You
	should all be using CVS anyway :) And as always, don't forget to
	report bugs! Anyway, since there's only been 9 days since the
	last release not much has changed. A bug-fix release and a version
	change mostly :)

0.11.0-pre15 (08/28/2001):
	Eric: This isn't a real release. Really. It's just a quick thing
	because pre14 doesn't cut it for some people. Also not counting
	the month break that I took it's been a month since the last
	release, so it's about time. You should all be using CVS anyway.
	Instructions are at http://gaim.sourceforge.net/cvs.shmtl. And
	don't forget to report bugs! http://gaim.sourceforge.net/bug.php3.

	Rob: Hey guys.  I've been rather inactive as well. It's a long
	story, but essentially, my company layed off a bunch of people,
	myself included, due to poor management.  I've taken a new
	job which required moving across the country.  I'm finally back
	online.  Once I manage to actually get a desk at home I'll be
	able to code with out infliciting intense pain upon my lower
	back and neck.  So, basically, we were inactive, but not dead.

	Also, just to keep you all updated, the AOL battle is still
	in progress.  Our lawyers are still in negotiation with thiers.
	We'll keep you updated with what happens.

0.11.0-pre14 (06/17/2001):
	Eric: Wee. Lots of fun things. BIG bug fix release. I did a lot of
	stupid things in the last one, hehe. You all forgive me though,
	right?

	Reality is always controlled by the people who are most insane.
	Remember that. It's a great Scott Adams quote.

	Rob: I feel naughty. I should have released this a lot earlier
	in the day.  I have a problem though. I started cooking, invited
	a couple friends over for dinner and then took a walk to a
	24hr doughnut shop where I sat outside and talked about
	random stuff.  Oh well, at least it's still before the 18th.

	Enjoy this release guys! :-)


0.11.0-pre13 (06/06/2001):
	Rob: \O.  Howdy doodie!  This release isn't coming too far behind
	the previous release but hey, what can ya say, there were a couple
	of good fixes in this one.  Jabber & IRC can set / view the topics
	of chat rooms now, napster doesnt crash on bad login names and
	passwords, and the man page got a big update.  

	Well, that's about all, folks.  Next release, I hope to try to get
	group MSN chat support added as well as DCC support in the IRC 
	plugin. 

	Peace!

	Eric: I apologize if any of you had to restart your X server because
	of me. This release won't make you have to do that, I promise. There
	were a couple other minor fixes with the buddy icon stuff, it still
	has a way to go but at least it's better than it was before. Oh yeah,
	and Oscar is able to sign on again.

0.11.0-pre12 (05/29/2001):
	Rob: Hi!  O/.  My girlfriend was visiting me so I've been busy being
	unavailable online.  Hooray.

	There have been a lot of good changes in this release.  Some improved
	dialogs, some updates to IRC and MSN, as well as a nifty little thing
	that Eric did that I'll let him tell you about.  

	Oh yeah, I also got food poisoned by bad eggs.  Ugh!

	Eric: Every protocol except TOC has been improved since the last
	release. All of them except Zephyr and ICQ now use the same proxy
	options, which you can set in the preferences. ICQ can use them if
	you set it to Socks5 though.

	There are a bunch of other good additions and fixes for each
	protocol which you can read about in the ChangeLog. And, there's one
	super cool feature that everyone seems to be asking for: Buddy Icons.
	Right now you can only receive them and only in Oscar, but hey, they're
	there.

	So that's it. Have fun with it :)

0.11.0-pre11 (04/30/2001):
	Rob: I bought a big carton of juice today.  It is now 50% empty.
	A lot of the plugins got some new options and/or improvements. I
        have a headache right now, though, so I won't say much.  I'll let
	Eric talk :)

	Eric: I uh. I bought 72 cans of soda yesterday. It only cost $15
	or so. I figure I'll be through it in less than two weeks. A
	dollar a day on soda isn't so bad. For the fourth release in a row,
	Oscar is fixed. Isn't that exciting. Judging from history I'd say
	that it won't stay fixed long; but judging from what I know has
	changed, we shouldn't have any more troubles.

	Rob: --. .- .. -- /  .. ... /  --. .-. . .- - --..-- /  --. .- .. -- /  
	     .. ... / --. --- --- -.. .-.-.-  

	I don't have a headache anymore!  Hooray! Eric got a good deal on those
	drinks.  I bought some bananas.  They're very green.  Oh, and I cooked
	a steak last night.  It was 16 oz.  It was good.  

0.11.0-pre10 (04/13/2001):
	Rob: EEP! It's Friday the 13th!!!  I think I fixed a few buggies
	in MSN and then added some new features to IRC.  I have a headache
	right now, though, so I won't talk much.  I think I'm going to go
	to sleep.  Next release, I should have a good bit more done on
	IRC and will have made Napster more stable.  Have fun!!

	Eric: There's a new protocol plugin, Zephyr. Don't use it! unless
	you know what Zephyr is, and have zhm set up correctly. Also there
	were a lot of other good bugfixes (like registering for Jabber
	accounts!) and a few neat features. In this release, Oscar is also
	working, but we'll see how long that lasts, eh?

0.11.0-pre9 (03/26/2001):
	Rob: Well, looks AOL was doing something naughty earlier this
	morning.  Thanks to a very nice guy named Adam Fritzler (you
	all know him from libfaim) we're now back online.  Thanks,
	Adam.  I'll buy you a drink sometime :-).  

0.11.0-pre8 (03/23/2001):
	Eric: Oo wow :) So I guess the big news is that this release should
	help you avoid the battle between Jabber and AOL. Most protocols
	got a few good bugfixes; thanks to people who pointed them out :).
	Hopefully for the next release I'll make it so you can register a
	jabber.org account, and then you can support Jabber using Gaim.
	I think (I *think*) Oscar blocking is working now. Haha, get it?
	Oscar blocking? It took me a while to get it, too. But no, really,
	I think that the permit/deny list in Oscar might be working.

	Rob: MSN got some fixes and should be really stable now.  It had 
	a little 100% CPU eating bug but that's taken care of now.  Next
	on my list of repairs is the napster plugin.  It works -- sorta --
	sometimes.  Heh.   As all of you probably know already, our Oscar
	support was broken yesterday.  There's a little battle going on
	between AOL and Jabber and we caught a bullet during the crossfire.
	I think I just won the award for the most cliches used in one
	paragraph, as a matter of fact. ;-). 

	** Good luck to the Jabber guys in getting this resolved **


0.11.0-pre7 (03/16/2001):
	Rob: Hey! I finally rewrote the MSN plugin.  Sorry, I'm just 
	a lazy code whore sometimes, heheh.  It pretty much has the same
	functionality as before with the exception of instability.  I
	didn't really like that feature very much so I removed it.  I hope
	you guys don't mind too terribly much ;-). 

	Eric: In this week's installment of gaim you'll find a new Yahoo!
	library and an option to have all conversations in one window,
	in addition to numerous bug fixes and other improvements. Don't
	forget to send us your feedback. If there's something you want
	added, changed, or fixed, head over to our SourceForge page at
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/gaim/ and tells us about it.


0.11.0-pre6 (03/06/2001):
	Eric: Yay! I get to go first!

	The biggest change in this release is the TODO file. Lots of things
	got added. There's going to be a lot of prereleases. Please help.
	Other than that it's mostly just a lot of bugfixes. Oscar got a few
	new features. Head on over to http://sourceforge.net/projects/gaim
	and tell us what you'd like to see in gaim. We've gotten a lot of
	great requests so far, thanks.

	I think I like releasing every week.

	Rob: I've been bad so Eric got to go first.  The biggest change
	In this release is the NEWS file.  It's the only thing I contributed
	to!  heh, just kidding.  This is a bug fix release, as Eric said.
	Next release will contain my newly rewritten MSN plugin.  You guys
	should be happy with it :).  

	Oh yeah, TUCAN rocks :)  Oh yeah, Eric rocks too. 


0.11.0-pre5 (02/26/2001):
	Rob: Yeah, I promise this is the last pre-release :-D.  That seems
	to be a pretty common saying around here, huh?  Well, I must first
	appologize.  The protocols that I was working on really should be
	much more developed at this point -- they should be completed,
	actually.  Unfortunately, my real life job (yes, I have one hehe) got
	a little too busy and ate up all of my free time.  I promise that
	things will get better now :).  

	Eric: I don't promise that this is the last pre-release. :) But
	hopefully releases can start coming more often than once every two
	months. I don't really have much else to say. It's been a slow
	couple of months.

	Rob: I promise to hack gaim again.  Please don't hate me.

0.11.0-pre4:
	Rob: HOORAY FOR DISNEYLAND!

	Eric: One more prerelease. I'm actually starting to think these
	prereleases are a good idea; a lot of people reported a lot of
	bugs in pre3 and most of them are fixed now. Also, it helps with
	the whole release early-release often philosophy.

	The big news in this prerelease is two more protocols: Jabber and
	Napster. Both of them don't have any of the features that make
	these services cool, yet. You can't use the transports in Jabber
	and you can't download file in Napster. But you will be able to,
	soon :)

	Rob and I are going on vacation starting today until after New
	Year's, which is a lot of the reason we wanted to get this release
	out; it's much improved over pre3. Happy Holidays everyone.

0.11.0-pre3 (12/15/2000):
	Rob: Well, I hadn't initially planned on an 0.11.0pre3 but it 
	looks like it was needed.  That's not necessarially a bad thing,
	mind you.  It just means you get to see more goodies!  
	
	This release includes some other fun features.  See the ChangeLog
	for more information.  Also found in this wonderful release is
	an MSN plugin.  For all of you who have been holding onto Windows
	simply because you have friends on MSN Messenger that you don't want
	to leave, this plugin is for you! :) 

	Guys, make sure you send us bug reports; preferably on the 
	SourceForge bug report forum at 
	http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/gaim/.  This will allow both
	Eric and I to handle the bugs and will prevent either one of us
	from losing the bug reports that are sent via AIM :-)

	Eric: Hey everybody, Rob and I really want to hear what you guys want
	to see in gaim. Head over to http://sourceforge.net/projects/gaim and
	leave a message in the Open Discussion forum. We've gotten a lot of
	good ideas so far (most of them didn't make it into this release,
	unfortunately).

	If any of you want to test out your mad coding skills, I can think of
	a few projects that would be incredibly useful. Send me or Rob an IM
	and we'll let you know how you can help. And don't forget to read the
	HACKING file to see how gaim's put together.

	This is hopefully going to be the last prerelease; now that all the
	protocols that we're going to be doing for 0.11.0 are available it's
	mostly just going to be hacking on them and getting them in usable
	condition before the final release. Don't forget to send us bug
	reports ;)

0.11.0-pre2 (12/04/2000):
	Rob: I messed up.  Oh well, it's fixed.

0.11.0-pre1 (12/03/2000):
	Rob: Hey guys!  Guess what!?  Yup, you're correct!  It's the pre1 
	release  of 0.11.0. We have all sorts of goodies in this release!  
	Check out the  ChangeLog file.  As always if you find any bugs, 
	please report them on www.sourceforge.net/projects/gaim/
	
	You may find several small bugs as this is still a prerelease.  

	You may want to note that my IRC plugin does not have full 
	functionality as of yet.  All of the important / commands will be 
	added before the final release. Also, if someone could send me 
	some good buddylist pixmaps for the irc plugin then I'd much 
	appreciate it.  Thanks to everyone who made this new release possible!

	If you have any ideas, comments, or suggestions, please let us know 
	either by e-mail or via the source forge message board at the URL 
	above. :)


	Eric: So what was Yay! For Gaim!? Yay was the codename for the 
	Yahoo plugin. The whole point of all of these changes was I wanted to 
	make a proof-of-concept plugin that would let Gaim sign into Yahoo. It 
	turned out to be pretty much impossible with the old code. So,
	Rob and I hacked gaim so we could do just that. There's now a whole new 
	class of plugins, Protocol Plugins, that let users dynamically add new 
	protocols to Gaim. Just load the plugin, and create a new account that 
	uses that protocol, and you're set! Yay! (Oscar and TOC are both still 
	static. Gaim is, after all, primarily an AIM client.)

	Lots of people have been very generous and contributed a lot of 
	time and  effort to writing some really nice patches for gaim since 
	the last release. To all of you, a big thanks.

0.10.3 (10/09/2000):
	Rob: I am dumb.
	Eric: I am not dumb.
	
0.10.2 (10/07/2000):
	Rob: What do you want me to say for yours?
	Eric: What happened since the last release?
	Rob: You got DSL.
	Eric: Oh yeah, I'm more available now.
	Rob: On a more serious note, this is just a quick release
	to hold everyone over.  Look for some very awesome things
	coming in the next version.  I can't say what, just yet,
	but what I can say is, Yay! For Gaim!

0.10.1 (09/15/2000):

	Rob: Hi Hi Hi!  Yet another gaim release pushed out the door
	for you guys.  I hope you all enjoy it.  There was a few minor
	issues cleared up in this version as well as the repair of
	OSCAR support.  Hopefully we won't run into the same problem
	as before.  Oh well ;-).  There's also a few small extra goodies
	in here for you guys just check out the Change Log.  I hope you all
	enjoy and take care! 

	Eric: Wanna know what the Oscar problem was? You'll laugh. 2 bytes.
	The fix was changing 0x07da to 0x0686. Anyway, aside from the fix
	for that, there are a couple other good things. Beware of DSL nazis.
	They won't give you service until 6 weeks after you order it. So um,
	yeah.

0.10.0 (09/11/2000):
	Rob: Well peoples, I know that it's been a while since our
	last release.  Here we go.  Some brand spankin' new interfaces
	for you guys to oogle at.  I hope you all enjoy it.  Hopefully
	our next release won't take as long to finish up.  Real life
	kind of crept up on Eric and I and took up a lot of our times.
	Life sucks that way sometimes.  Anyways, we're back and all
	is well.  Thanks for hanging in there guys and we hope
	you enjoy it! 

	Eric: LWE was so cool. Rob and I met up there, we had a blast. But I
	only got to go for one day and Rob got to go for three. Lucky bastard.
	It's been so long since the last release that I don't even remember
	what's changed. But all of it is good :) Like Rob said, all kinds of
	new UI stuff. I think there are some new features in there too. Now
	I'm headed back to school so I'll have more time to hack gaim (isn't
	that supposed to be the reverse?), just as soon as I get my internet
	connection back >:-/ .

	Rob: Oh yeah, some of our pixmaps may need a little work.  We took
	a lot of them from the Gnome Stock icons.  If anyone could do some
	custom ones that stay within the 24x24 boundary and keep the same
	idea and feel as the gnome icons then we would be more than happy
	to use them.  Thanks much!! Viva la LWE.
 

0.9.20 (07/14/2000):
	Rob: Well, guys, I hope you enjoy this version.  I've done quite a bit
	of work to the user interface.  It's still not in the state that I
	would like it to be, though.  Over the next few versions you will
	notice a few more interface changes as we try to bring a more
	professional look to Gaim.  As always, we will stay true to our
	pimpin' penguin atittude. 

	Eric: While Rob's been busy making things pretty, I've been busy
	making things work :). The chat and IM windows got merged, which
	means that they both have the same features (notably, IM has /me
	and chat has font/color dialogs and smileys). Also smileys should
	work better in general now (thanks fflew).
	
	Rob: By the way, what Eric is saying is that he's smart and I'm
	not and that he does all of the work and I sit on my butt all
	day and claim to do work.  WOOO!  Just kidding, brother :-P


0.9.19 (06/09/2000):
	Rob: PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA 
	PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA 
	PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA  

	All of that nonsense aside, there are a few things that DIDN'T happen
	in this version of gaim.  The user interface changes will wait until
	the 0.9.20 release.  We've decided to turn 0.9.19 into a "new feature
	and major bug fix" release.  All/Most major bugs should be worked out
	now.  We're sorry about the problem of segfaulting when your buddylist
	stored on the server was null.  Oops! We won't let it happen again,
	we promise.

	Eric: Lots of good changes in this one, including locale support. Chat
	had a lot of things done to it, but it's still not finished. The UI
	didn't get the overhaul we were planning, but we wanted to get a few
	bugfixes out.

	Lemme say something about reporting bugs. Please do. Please try to give
	as much information as you can. But regardless of how much information
	you give, please be POLITE. If you tell us our software is crap then
	we're probably not going to respond well.
	
	Rob: Before I close up and say goodnight, I'd like to say that I 
	agree with Eric.  Reporting problems and/or helpful criticism in
	a polite manner always yields the best results.  Peace all, and 
	happy hacking.

0.9.18 (06/02/2000):
	Rob: Talk about release early, release often - sheesh!  We're going
	insane.  Ya know, I'm not too happy with the Gaim UI.  I dont know
	how the rest of you feel but it's time for a nice overhaul.  In the
	next few days I'll be sitting down with some of my friends and coming
	up with an improved interface.  I hope you all enjoy it.  It'll
	include better looking dialogs, icons, sounds (hopefully lol), etc.

	And -- for your random silly message of the day --

	"Beans and Franks, Beans and Franks, Wine And Beer, Have No Fear!
	I can sing! I can dance! I have a penguin in my pants!"

			- Rob Flynn after not having enough sleep.

	Eric: I've had less sleep than Rob, I can guarantee you that. There's
	actually a lot going on in this release, despite 2 releases 2 days ago.
	Don't ask me how; I think the elves had something to do with it.

	Oscar support is almost to the point where I'm considering removing
	the 'experimental' label from configure. For those of you brave enough
	to try it, I'd like feedback. (And if you happen to write a patch to
	fix some of the stuff that would be really cool too.) Hopefully for the
	next release, in addition to the cool new UI, Gaim/Faim will be able to
	do nearly everything Gaim/TOC can do. (Big things coming in 0.9.19, I
	can feel it....)

	And just remember, you *can* have too many gummi candies. Especially if
	you eat nearly a whole kilo of them. Believe me. I know. But the gummi
	cherries are damn good.

0.9.17 (05/31/2000):
	Rob: I am an e-mail fiend!
	(after receiving 60 emails within a 5 minute period about a problem
	and responding to all of them immediately)

	I am stupid.

	Eric: Heh heh. 2 releases in one day. I'm impressed. Maybe one of these
times we'll actually get some of it right ;) Anyway, yeah. Just bug fixes in
this one.

	Rob: Yeah, we wouldn't be ourselves if we released it once and got it right, would we? :-)

0.9.16:
	Rob: Blah Blah Blah.

	Eric: Looks like Rob didn't have much to say, so I'll write something
instead :)

	There's a few good things in this release, the most important of them
being: Better proxy support, of course. Oh yeah, and you can sign on now,
so that's a good thing too. There's a few more good things going on in this
release, so check out the ChangeLog. 

	Play nicely, and we'll keep hacking away at it.

	Rob: Go Watch `Road Trip'. 

0.9.15:
	Hey boy's and girls.  There's not much to say here this time.
We're loving Southern California, the new job's going great.  We just
got our company website up and the product development is going pretty
smooth.  Life's pretty sweet now.  

	We've hacked up all kinds of goodies for you in 0.9.15.  There's
some file transfer (receive) support for those of you who have been
wanting it for a while. There's some other misc. goodies tossed in as
well.  Enjoy!! Oh yeah, we need a new website.  Come up with a sweet
design and get in touch with me.  The current site is at:
http://www.marko.net/gaim

Thanks much!


0.9.14:
	Well, there's a few random hacks and fixes in here, along with
a little suprise.  You guessed it, kiddos, support for plugins!  Happy
hacking!

0.9.13:
	Not much to say for this release.  Bug fixes, That's all.  Look
for the goodies I promised in 0.9.13 to appear in 0.9.14 which should be
released very soon now.  

	By the way, our CVS is now hosted over at source forge.  Go check
it out at http://www.sourceforge.net.  Please check there before submitting
any bug reports (You can read our CVS comments to see if we have fixed any
problems).

0.9.12:
	Well guys, looks like we got some nifty things in this version.
TrueType Fonts are supported for those XFSTT buffs out there (or whatever
else you use).  A crap load of those plaguing memory leaks have FINALLY been
fixed.  My brother, Jeramey, and a new friend Peter Teichan helped stomp
those babies out.  A rad guy by the name of Eric Warmenhoven has been
really sweet lately and has all but rewritten the Gnome Applet support :).
He submitted patch after patch.  I finally got annoyed with him (just kidding bud)
and gave him CVS access.  Look for Gnome Applet support in Gaim to start improving.
That's about all for now.  I wanted to get this release out there.  File Receive
support will be in 0.9.13 which is due out soon.
	
0.9.11:
	Jeramey got a new Comfy Chair! Its very very comfy!  Whee!
Jim also had a little hyper-drunken moment and started hacking away at
a new configuration format for Gaim.  Looks like we're running .gaimrc
version 1 now.  Gotta love it.  I got bored and hacked in a couple font
properties that will, in time, contain more features.  That's about it
for this version -- cept for that memory leak we fixed.  Shush! We're
not plumbers! -- rob

** Extra special update **

Well guys, it looks like we all stopped working on gaim, moved to California,
and took up a new job.  Don't worry though, those beach bums out here havent
worn off on us yet.  I've decided to pick up the Gaim torch myself and continue
development ont he prohect.  Hopefully we wont have any more five month braks in
the project.  Sorry about that, guys :)

0.9.10: 
	Umm.  Dont ask.  Silly memory leak.  For those of you who
wondered, you were losing about 256 bytes every 25 seconds for each
person you have on your contact list.  Make fun of us.  Better yet ..
Send us beer.  We'll do better :)

0.9.9:
	Welp, All of you boys and girls who run Mandrake and have some
problems with Gaim working properly, please check out the FAQ file.  It 
contains a nice fix submitted by one of our users.  I hope this works for
you guys!
	Jim appears to have intoxicated himself.  This is, as always, a
Good Thing (tm).  His late-night adventure with the liquid-bread food group
lead to the birth of a nice little feature called `The Lag-O-Meter'.  Dont
ask, just try it out :).  It is pretty pointless if you have a super-fast
connection but if you are a modem user, like many of us are, then try it out.
	There's also some idle preferences and some other little random
bug fixes.  Check'em out yo :)

0.9.8:
	Get Along Lil' Doggies.  Heh.  Looks like we have yet another new
version of gaim for you guys to play with.  Be gentle now, it has a few
new fetures.  The HTML widget is now more robust and we have *da da da* 
HTTP proxy support.  
	Oh By The Way, Do not pay too much attention to what we are doing
with this release.  We are all a little bit happy tonight.  You must love
life.  This is a special release of gaim.  We will be releasing some wonderful
photographs soon .. or perhaps if we get the bloody webcam working then we
will take a couple of quick snapshots.
	Looks like the Gaim developers convention (cool name huh) that we
had this weekend in Auburn, AL went wonderfully :).  yum yum yum. Hahahah. Oh
by the way.  Beware of insecure rednecks in the deli.  Bad things.
	In (non)related news, Jeramey could not successfully slaughter the
one pound hamburger that he ordered.  (I think he could have done it but he
wasn't feeling very well at the time).
	Oh Yes, New Logo Too :) You likes? Thanks, Naru!
	Just a little side-note: it looks like we didnt make the release that
we had expected during the Gaim Convention.  Maybe we partied too much? I am
not sure.  I remember watching the sun rise before I went to bed, though.
Oh well.  Here's your release!  Enjoy!
	By The Way, we have uploaded our party pictures to a website.
http://www.dorky.net/gaim/party/  They are nothing spectacular but I hope you
enjoy them! :).

0.9.7:
	Well, boys and girls, it's that time again!  Yup, time for the good
release fairy to come bless us with her infinite wisdom and divine presence.
Umm, yeah, something like that.  Anyways, this release has several little
"bad" network fixes (as Jim likes to say) and a couple touch-ups to a few
other features.  It also features preliminary oscar support.  Thanks to Jim
and Adam ("the libfaim guy")  hehe :)  We have also corrected a problem with
gaim not wainting to correctly save your password if you have an underscore
in it.  Thanks to w1za7d for pointing out the underscore problem.  ' and \
have also been fixed in passwords. :o) 

0.9.6:
	Sorry about the little segfaulting bugs in the past release.  Rob
is stupid. :).  Anyways, they have been patched up and a couple new features
have been added.  I hope you guys enjoy.

0.9.5:
	Well we added a myriad of new features to this release. (A lot of
small buggie fixes too.)  If you need a detailed list just check out the
ChangeLog.  We now have a new webpage design and have added a FAQ to the
distribution.  Before coming to us with any problems please take a quick
look through the FAQ to make sure we havent already covered your question.
	Also, thanks to our beloved Web Monkey, FlynOrange, we have all
learned the true power of foam weapons, slinkies, and whoopie cushions.  Hmm
gotta love those pranks, eh?

0.8.0:
	Well, just starting the NEWS file.  I'll try to remember what's new
from the last version.  Hmmm.  BIG code reorg.  Import/export, buddy pounce
among the major new features.  Autoconf script too, which is a big win.
Apologies to those who submitted patches which haven't made it in.. I
promise, the next version!  This code reorg took up a lot of my time, and I
want to get it out there.
