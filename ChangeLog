	  Talk used for accounts on arbitrary domains not using Google Apps
	  for Your Domain). (#a14153)
	* Improved handling of adding oneself to your buddy list when using
	  Non-SASL (legacy) authentication. (#12499)
	* Generate a connection error instead of just stalling when the
	  _xmppconnect TXT record returns results, but none of them result

	  connections. (#12532)
	* Fix sending SMS messages.  The lookup host changed on us.  (Thanks to

	* Stop doing unnecessary lookups of certain alias information.  This
	  solves deadlocks when a given Yahoo account has a ridiculously large
	  (>500 buddies) list and may improve login speed for those on slow
	  connections. (#12532)

version 2.7.3 (08/10/2010):
	General:
	* Use silent build rules for automake >1.11. You can enable verbose
	  builds with the --disable-silent-rules configure option, or using
	  make V=1.

	* Fix the TURN server settings (broken in 2.7.0).

	Pidgin:
	* Re-focus the input area after clicking the attention toolbar button.

	  updated their avatar, request the new avatar image from the server.
	* Fix a possible crash if a link is clicked while disconnected.
	* Unescape any escaped characters in a chatroom nickname.
	* Add the new MXit moods and emoticons.

	  a fallback to legacy IQ authentication (broken in 2.7.0).
	* Fix a crash when receiving custom emoticons that don't adhere to
	  the specification.
	* When initiating a file transfer, don't show resources that are certain
	  to not support file transfers in the resource selection dialog.
	* Fix connecting to servers using BOSH and authenticating with
	  DIGEST-MD5 when libpurple was built with Cyrus SASL support.

	Yahoo/Yahoo JAPAN:
	* Renamed "Use account proxy for SSL connections" to "Use account proxy
	  for HTTP and HTTPS requests" and tied the option to HTTP requests too.
	* Properly detect HTTP proxy server use when the HTTP proxy is the
	  global proxy server, an account-level non-HTTP proxy server is
	  configured, and the "Use account proxy for HTTP and HTTPS requests"
	  account option is turned off.  This fixes connecting for some HTTP
	  proxy servers.
	* Fall back to connecting to scsa.msg.yahoo.com (not configurable) if
	  the HTTP-based connect server lookup fails.  This does not work for
	  Yahoo JAPAN accounts.

version 2.7.1 (05/29/2010):
	General:
	* Build fixes on OpenSolaris.  (Brian Lu)
	* Add configure option --enable-trayicon-compat which installs tray
	  icons into directories that are compatible with older versions of
	  hicolor-icon-theme (0.9).

	Pidgin:
	* Restore the tray icon's blinking functionality.
	* Fix a crash setting moods when an account is disconnected.

	* Replace the MXit-specific mood management with the new standard Moods
	  API.
	* Add the standard MXit emoticons.
	* Improve the handling of users being kicked from MultiMX rooms.
	* MXit doesn't allow you to see your buddy's Email Address or Title,
	  so remove those two fields from the "Buddy Information" page.
	* Show buddy's Registration Country in their profile.
	* Increment protocol version to v6.0
	* If an invite you sent was rejected with a reason, display that
	  message in the buddy tooltip.

	General:
	* Changed GTK+ minimum version requirement to 2.10.0.
	* Changed GLib minimum version requirement to 2.12.0.

	* Fix two related crashes in the GnuTLS and NSS plugins when they
	  suffer internal errors immediately upon attempting to establish
	  an SSL connection.
	* Fix NSS to work when reinitialized after being used.  (Thanks to
	  Ludovico Cavedon for the testcase)
	* Added support for PURPLE_GNUTLS_PRIORITIES environment variable.
	  This can be used to specify GnuTLS priorities on a per-host basis.
	  The format is "host=priority;host2=priority;...".  The default
	  priority can be overridden by using "*" as the host.  See the
	  GnuTLS manual for documentation on the format of the priority
	  strings.
	* Fix autoconf detection of Python.  (Brad Smith)
	* Fix a crash when a Windows proxy (from IE) does not have a port.

	* Added UI for sending attentions (buzz, nudge) on supporting protocols.
	* Make the search dialog unobtrusive in the conversation window (by
	  making it look and behave like the search dialog in Firefox)
	* The Recent Log Activity sort method for the Buddy List now
	  distinguishes between no activity and a small amount of activity
	  in the distant past.  (Greg McNew)
	* Added a menu set mood globally for all mood-supporting accounts
	  (currently XMPP and ICQ).
	* Default binding of Ctrl+Shift+v to 'Paste as Plain Text' in
	  conversation windows. This can be changed in .gtkrc-2.0. For example,
	  Ctrl+v can be bound to 'Paste as Plain Text' by default.
	* Plugins can now handle markup in buddy names by attaching to the
	  "drawing-buddy" signal. (Daniele Ricci, Andrea Piccinelli)
	* Be more accommodating when scaling down large images for use as
	  buddy icons.
	* The 'Message Timestamp Formats' plugin allows changing the timestamp
	  format from the timestamps' context menu in conversation log.
	* The 'Message Timestamp Formats' plugin allows forcing 12-hour
	  timestamps.  (Jonathan Maltz)

	  having garbage appended to them).
	* Show file transfer thumbnails for images on supporting protocols
	  (currently only supported on MSN).

	Bonjour:

	Gadu-Gadu:
	* Updated our bundled libgadu to 1.9.0-rc2 (many thanks to Krzysztof
	  Klinikowski for the work and testing put in here!)
	* Minimum requirement for external libgadu is now also 1.9.0-rc2.

	AIM and ICQ:
	* X-Status (Custom ICQ status icon) support.  Since most of the icons
	  available reflect moods, this is labeled "Set Mood" on the
	  Accounts->ICQ Account menu. (Andrew Ivanov, Tomáš Kebert,
	  Yuriy Yevgrafov, and trac users bob007, salieff, and nops)
	* Allow setting and displaying icons between 1x1 and 100x100 pixels for
	  ICQ.  Previously only icons between 48x48 and 52x64 were allowed.
	* When using the clientLogin authentication method, prompt for a
	  password on reconnect when "Remember Password" is not checked and
	  authentication fails due to an incorrect password.  (This is the same
	  behavior as the legacy authentication method)
	* Support sending and receiving HTML-formatted messages for ICQ.
	* Use the proper URL for "View web profile" link for ICQ buddies.
	  (Alexander Nartov)

	MSN:
	* Support for version 9 of the MSN protocol has been removed.  This
	  version is no longer supported on the servers.
	* Support file transfer thumbnails (previews) for images.
	* Fix CVE-2010-1624 (custom emoticon remote crash).

	XMPP:
	* Direct messages to a specific resource only upon receipt of a message
	  with content (as opposed to a typing notification, etc).  (Thanks to
	  rjoly for testing)
	* Present a better error message when authentication fails while trying
	  to connect to Facebook.  (David Reiss, Facebook)
	* When sending data using in-band-bytestreams, interpret the block-size
	  attribute as the size of the BASE64-encoded representation of the
	  data.
	* Validate the hash on incoming BoB data objects (for custom smileys
	  etc.), cache based per JID when the CID is not a valid hash (as
	  specified by the BoB XEP).
	* Send whitespace keepalives if we haven't sent data in a while (2
	  minutes).  This fixes an issue with Openfire disconnecting a
	  libpurple-baesd client that has just been quiet for about 6
	  minutes.
	* Only support Google Talk's JID Domain Discovery extension
	  (allowing a user to log in with "@gmail.com" or "@googlemail.com"
	  interchangeably) for those two domains.  This change was made
	  due to interoperability issues with some BOSH Connection Managers
	  and namespaced attributes.

	Yahoo/Yahoo JAPAN:
	* Attempt to better handle transparent proxies interfering with
	  HTTP-based login.
	* Fix handling of P2P packets, thus fixing the loss of some messages.
	* Retrieve the pager server address from Yahoo!'s servers directly.
	* Removed the "Pager server" account option, as it is no longer needed.
	* The authentication code is now less order-sensitive with the
	  components of the server's response.

	* Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, Windows ME
	  (Millennium Edition), and Windows NT 4.0 longer supported due to GTK+
	  requirements changes.
	* Crash Report files (pidgin.RPT) are now generated in the ~/.purple
	  directory instead of the installation directory.
	* NSS SSL Library upgraded to 3.12.5 (thanks to Berke Viktor)
	* GtkSpell upgraded to 2.0.16, changing the spellchecking backend to
	  enchant.  This means that myspell and hunspell (OpenOffice)
	  dictionaries can be used (previous versions' aspell dictionaries
	  will not work).

version 2.6.6 (02/18/2010):
	libpurple:
	* Fix 'make check' on OS X. (David Fang)
	* Fix a quirk in purple_markup_html_to_xhtml that caused some messages
	  to be improperly converted to XHTML.
	* Set "controlling-mode" correctly when initializing a media session.
	  Fixes receiving voice calls from Psi.
	* When looking up DNS records, use the type of record returned by the
	  server (instead of the type we asked for) to determine how to process
	  the record.
	* Fix an issue with parsing XML attributes that contain "&lt;br&gt;".
	  See ChangeLog.API for more details.

	General:
	* Correctly disable all missing dependencies when using the
	  --disable-missing-dependencies option.  (Gabriel Schulhof)

	Gadu-Gadu:
	* Fix display of avatars after a server-side change. (Krzysztof
	  Klinikowski)

	AIM:
	* Allow setting and displaying icons between 1x1 and 100x100 pixels.
	  Previously only icons between 48x48 and 50x50 were allowed.

	MSN:
	* Fix CVE-2010-0277, a possible remote crash when parsing an incoming
	  SLP message.  (Discovered by Fabian Yamaguchi)
	* File transfer requests will no longer cause a crash if you delete the
	  file before the other side accepts.
	* Received files will no longer hold an extra lock after completion,
	  meaning they can be moved or deleted without complaints from your OS.
	* Buddies who sign in from a second location will no longer cause an
	  unnecessary chat window to open.
	* Support setting an animated GIF as a buddy icon.
	* Numerous code cleanups and memory savings.

	MySpace:
	* Fix a leak and crash when retrieving buddy icons.

	XMPP:
	* Less likely to send messages to a contact's idle/inactive resource.
	  Previously, if a message was received from a specific resource,
	  responses would be sent to that resource until either it went offline
	  or a message is received from another resource.  Now, messages are
	  sent to the bare JID upon receipt of any presence change from the
	  contact.
	* Added support for the SCRAM-SHA-1 SASL mechanism.  This is only
	  available when built without Cyrus SASL support.
	* When getting info on a domain-only (server) JID, show uptime
	  (when given by the result of the "last query") and don't show status
	  as offline.
	* Fix getting info on your own JID.
	* Wrap XHTML messages in <p>, as described in XEP-0071, for
	  compatibility with some clients.
	* Don't do an SRV lookup for a STUN server associated with the account
	  if one is already set globally in prefs.
	* Don't send custom smileys larger than the recommended maximum object
	  size specified in the BoB XEP.   This prevents a client from being
	  disconnected by servers that dislike overly-large stanzas.
	* Fix receiving messages without markup over an Openfire BOSH
	  connection (forcibly put the stanzas in the jabber:client namespace).
	* The default value for the file transfer proxies is automatically
	  updated when an account connects, if it is still the old (broken)
	  default (from 'proxy.jabber.org' to 'proxy.eu.jabber.org').
	* Fix an issue where libpurple created duplicate buddies if the roster
	  contains a buddy in two groups that differ only by case
	  (e.g. "XMPP" and "xmpp") (or not at all).

	Yahoo:
	* Don't send <span> and </span> tags.  (Fartash Faghri)
	* Support PingBox.  PingBoxes will appear as pbx/PingBoxName.  (Kartik
	  Mohta)

	Pidgin:
	* Fix CVE-2010-0423, a denial of service attack due to the parsing
	  of large numbers of smileys.  (Discovered by Antti Hayrynen)
	* Correctly size conversation and status box entries when the
	  interior-focus style property is diabled. (Gabriel Schulhof)
	* Correctly handle a multiline text field being required in a
	  request form.  (Thanks to Florian Zeitz for finding this problem)
	* Search friends by email-addresses in the buddy list. (Luoh Ren-Shan)

	  PURPLE_GNUTLS_DEBUG environment variable, which is an integer between
	  0 and 9 (higher is more verbose). Higher values may reveal sensitive
	  information.
	* PURPLE_VERBOSE_DEBUG environment variable.  Currently, this is an "on"
	  or "off" variable.  Set it to any value to turn it on and unset it to
	  turn it off.  This will optionally be used to only show less useful
	  debug information on an as-needed basis.
	* PURPLE_LEAKCHECK_HELP environment variable.  Currently, this is an
	  "on" or "off" variable.  Set it to any value to turn it on and unset

	  offline buddy, provided the server supports it.
	* Support custom smileys in MUCs (only when all participants support the
	  "Bits of Binary" extension, and a maximum of 10 participants are in
	  the chat to avoid getting too many fetch requests).
	* Fix an issue with Jabber (pre-XMPP) servers and the user's preference
	  to require SSL not being respected.
	* Fix an issue where Cyrus SASL DIGEST MD5 authentication might fail if

	  used (as in previous versions).
	* Topics that contain '<' followed by a non-whitespace character can now
	  be set properly.

	  but it should resolve at least some of the most common ones.
	* The pager server will automatically update to scsa.msg.yahoo.com if the

	  prevents seeing an outdated alias or not seeing an alias at all for
	  buddies who are offline when you sign in.
	* Update tokens for FindMembership and ABFindAll SOAP requests.
	* We no longer try to send empty messages.  This could happen when a
	  message contained only formatting and that formatting was not supported
	  on MSN.
	* Buddies on both the Allow and Block list are now automatically
	  removed from the Allow list.  Users with this problem will now no
	  longer receive an ADL 241 error.  The problematic buddy should now
	  appear on the buddy list and can be removed or unblocked as desired.

	XMPP:
	* Resources using __HOSTNAME__ substitution will now grab only the short
	  hostname instead of the FQDN on systems which put the FQDN in the
	  hostname. (Matěj Cepl)
	* No longer send a 'to' attribute on an outgoing stanza when we haven't
	  received one.  This fixes a registration bug as described in ticket

	  notifications when the same buddy is in multiple groups. (Florian
	  Quèze)
	* The Buddy State Notification plugin no longer turns JID's, MSN

	  Authority" certificates. These are now always installed even when
	  using --with-system-ssl-certs because most systems don't ship
	  those intermediate certificates.
	* The Games and Office media can now be set and displayed (in
	  addition to the previous Music media). The Media status text now
	  shows the album, if possible.
	* Messages sent from a mobile device while you were offline are now
	  correctly received.
	* Server transfers after you've been connected for a long time
	  should now be handled correctly.

	  resource for us where supported. (Jonathan Sailor)
	* Resources now default to no value, but "Home" is used if the
	  server refuses to provide a resource.
	* Quit trying to get user info for MUC's. (Paul Aurich)
	* Send "client-accepts-full-bind-result" attribute during SASL
	  login. This will fix Google Talk login failures if the user
	  configures the wrong domain for his/her account.
	* Support new <metadata/> element to indicate no XEP-0084 User
	  Avatar. (Paul Aurich)
	* Fix SHA1 avatar checksum errors that occur when one of the bytes

	  Terry)
	* Fix a 10 second delay waiting on tzc if it is not installed or the
	  configured command is invalid. (Michael Terry)

	Pidgin:
	* On GTK+ 2.14 and higher, we're using the gtk-tooltip-delay setting
	  instead of our own (hidden) tooltip_delay pref.  If you had
	  previously changed that pref, add a line like this to
	  ~/.purple/gtkrc-2.0 (where 500 is the timeout (in ms) you want):
	      gtk-tooltip-timeout = 500
	  To completely disable tooltips (e.g. if you had an old
	  tooltip_delay of zero), add this to ~/.purple/gtkrc-2.0:
	      gtk-enable-tooltips = 0
	* Moved the release notification dialog to a mini-dialog in the
	  buddylist. (Casey Ho)
	* Fix a crash when closing an authorization minidialog with the X

	  saved status manager, rather than edit the status.

	Finch:
	* Allow binding meta+arrow keys for actions.
	* Added default meta+erase binding for delete previous word.
	* Added "Show When Offline" to buddy menus, so a plugin is no longer
	  needed.

version 2.5.2 (10/19/2008):
	libpurple:
	* Fixed a crash on removing a custom buddy icon on a buddy.
	* Fixed a crash caused by certain self-signed SSL certificates.
	* Enable a number of strong ciphers which were previously disabled
	  when using NSS.  (Thanks to Marcus Trautwig.)

	Pidgin:
	* The status selector now saves your message when changing status.
	* Fix a case where a conversation window could close unexpectedly.
	* A mute sounds option has been added to the preferences window to

	  control plugin, or setting the color in ~/.gtkrc-2.0)
	* Fix a crash occuring when a custom smiley is deleted and re-added and
	  used in an open conversation after being re-added.

	* A new 'Nested Grouping' option in the 'Grouping' plugin. Group
	  hierarchies are defined by the '/' character in the group names.
	* A bug was fixed where some key-bindings wouldn't work with some TERMs
	  (e.g. xterm-color, screen-linux etc.)

	MSN:
	* Operations (such as moving to a new group) on contacts that were added
	  in the same session should now complete correctly, and not cause
	  synchronization errors at next login.
	* Minor fixes to login process during a server transfer.
	* Restored the "Has You" feature to the MSN protocol tooltips.
	* ADL 205/214/etc errors should no longer prevent login.

	XMPP:
	* Sending and receiving custom smileys using the specification in
	  XEP-0231 (bits of binary) and XHTML-IM

	Yahoo:
	* Only send a Ping once every hour.  This prevents the account from
	  being disconnected from the server periodically.

version 2.5.1 (08/30/2008):
	libpurple:
	* In the Join/Part plugin, add the ability to apply the rules to
	  buddies.  By default, joins and parts for buddies are still shown.
	* Support SOCKS proxies specified in GNOME or Windows proxy settings.
	* Fix some possible crashes in MSNP15.
	* Enable a default SSL trust relationship for MSN servers.
	* Avoid disconnecting from XMPP servers on parse errors that are
	  non-fatal.
	* Include some perl files that were mistakenly omitted in 2.5.0.

	Pidgin:

	  are connecting.

version 2.5.0 (08/18/2008):
	libpurple:
	* Ability to create custom smileys (currently only the MSN protocol
	  utilizes the feature). (Thanks to Mauro Sérgio Ferreira Brasil,
	  Marcus Lundblad, Jorge Villaseñor and other contributors)
	* Add a configure option, --with-system-ssl-certs to allow packagers
	  to specify a system-wide SSL CA certificates directory.  When set,
	  we don't install our SSL CA certs, so it's important that the
	  libpurple package depend on the CA certificates.
	* Add SSL Certificates support to the NSS SSL plugin. (Thanks to Lou
	  Cipher)

	XMPP:
	* Fix a bug that caused the UI to not refresh and caused the client
	  to use 99% CPU when an XMPP account lost its connection to the
	  server.
	* Possibly fix a bug where some clients could get into a state
	  where they moved a buddy back and forth between two groups in
	  an endless loop.

	IRC:
	* /ctcp command (Vladislav Guberinić)
	* Allow for auto-detection of incoming UTF-8 formatted text on
	  accounts which are configured to use some other encoding.

	MSN:
	* Update MSN support to protocol 15 (Elliott Sales de Andrade, Jorge
	  Villaseñor, Mike Ruprecht, Carlos Silva, Ma Yuan, Daniel Ljungborg
	  and others)
	* Personal messages are now supported. They are treated as status
	  messages.
	* Offline IM is now supported.

	  longer crashes.
	* Custom smileys received in a chat no longer go to a new window.
	* Processing is no longer completely frozen after the servers block a
	  message because it contains (what they consider) inappropriate text.

	Pidgin:
	* Custom buddy icons can now be added to and removed from buddy list
	  entries via the buddy list entry right-click menu.
	* Resize large incoming custom smileys to a maximum of 96px on either
	  side.

	* Added "View All Logs" menu in the buddylist to display a list of all IM
	  logs.
	* Added '/msgcolor' command to change colors of different classes of
	  messages in a conversation. See '/help msgcolor' for details.
	* Added tab-completion for commands in conversation windows.

version 2.4.3 (07/01/2008):
	libpurple:
	* Yahoo! Japan now uses UTF-8, matching the behavior of official clients
	  and restoring compatibility with the web messenger (Yusuke Odate)
	* Setting your buddy icon once again works for Yahoo! accounts.
	* Fixes in the Yahoo! protocol to prevent a double free, crashes on
	  aliases, and alias functionality
	* Fix crashes in the bonjour protocol

	* Fix a crash when the given jabber id is invalid.
	* Make the IRC "unknown message" debugging messages UTF-8 safe.
	* Fix connecting to ICQ
	* Fix a memleak when handling jabber xforms.

	Pidgin:
	* Include the send button plugin in the win32 build
	* Various memory leak fixes

version 2.4.2 (05/17/2008):
	http://developer.pidgin.im/query?status=closed&milestone=2.4.2
	libpurple:
	* In MySpaceIM, messages from spambots are discarded (Justin Williams)
	* Strip mIRC formatting codes from quit and part messages.
	* IRC now displays ban lists in-channel for joined channels.
	* Fixed a bug where the list of loaded plugins would get removed when
	  switching between different operating systems.
	* Fix reception of IRC PART without a part message on Undernet
	  (fixes a problem with litter in the channel user list).
	* IRC no longer crashes on /list on servers which erroneously omit
	  RPL_LISTSTART.
	* Update the NetworkManager support to use D-Bus directly, instead of
	  libnm-glib.  Hopefully it's stable now.  It will now compile by
	  default if you have D-Bus support and NetworkManager.h. (Elliott
	  Sales de Andrade)
	* MSN buddy list synchronization is now more forgiving, only asking
	  about buddies who have disappeared completely from the server list
	  and not those that have simply moved groups.
	* IRC will now try to append 1-9 to your nick if it is in use, instead
	  of substituting the last character with 1-9 where possible.
	* Bonjour buddies will be saved persistently if they're moved out of
	  the "Bonjour" group. (Eion Robb)

	Pidgin:
	* The typing notification in the conversation history can be disabled or
	  customized (font, color etc.) in .gtkrc-2.0.
	* Added a plugin (not installed by default) which adds a Send button
	  back to the conversation window. People without physical keyboards
	  have a hard time with the lack of the button.
	* Clicking on the buddyicon in the conversation window toggles the
	  size of the icon between small and large.
	* The settings of a chat (e.g. Handle in an XMPP chat, or Exchange in
	  an AIM chat) can be edited from its context menu in the buddy list.
	* Add a "Present conversation window" preference to the Message
	  Notification plugin; the "Raise conversation window" option does not
	  unminimize windows or draw attention to them when they are on other
	  workspaces--the "Present" option should.
	* Add a preference to set Escape as the keyboard shortcut for closing
	  the conversation window.
	* Add an option in the context menu to disable smileys in the selected
	  text in the conversation history/log viewer. This should help people
	  who regularly paste code in conversations.
	* Add a preference to choose the minimum size of the text input area in
	  lines.
	* Moved the "Local alias" field in the Modify Account dialog to be below
	  the "User Options" heading on the "Basic" tab.
	* Number of room occupants is now shown in chat tooltips where possible

	General:
	* The configure script now dies on more absent dependencies.  The
	  --disable-xxx arguments to configure can be used to bypass unneeded
	  dependencies.  This will also cause the configure script to die if an
	  --enable-xxx option is used and the dependencies it requires are
	  missing.
	* The Evolution integration plugin must now be explicitly enabled.  Use
	  the --enable-gevolution argument to configure to enable it.
	* The Contact Availability Prediction plugin must now be explicitly
	  enabled.  Use the --enable-cap argument to configure to enable it.

	Finch:
	* New default binding ctrl+x to open context menus.
	* Menu triggers and other bindings will no longer conflict.
	* Middle click pastes the internal clipboard (when mouse support is
	  enabled).

version 2.4.1 (03/31/2008):
	http://developer.pidgin.im/query?status=closed&milestone=2.4.1

	libpurple:
	* Treat AIM Unicode messages as UTF-16 rather than UCS-2; this
	  should have no functional effect, other than continued support
	  on systems which have dropped UCS-2 conversions.
	* Add support for setting buddy icons on Gadu-Gadu (Tomasz Salacinski)
	* Fix a crash when clearing the buddy icon for an account on XMPP
	* Fix a crash during login for some ICQ accounts
	* Prefer more available resources on XMPP when priorities are equal
	* Fix incorrectly marking some Yahoo! contacts as blocked
	* Improved handling of UTF-8 group names on ICQ (beret)
	* Fix a crash when starting if you have a Zephyr account
	* Increase XMPP ping timeout to 120 seconds, to prevent poor network
	  connections from timing out unnecessarily.
	* Don't crash on XMPP forms with empty default values.
	* Fix issues with CHAP authentication for SOCKS5 proxies.

	Pidgin:
	* Remove a workaround for older versions gstreamer that was causing
	  crashes on some non-Linux systems such as HPUX
	* Fix some cases of the conversation input entry area being 1 pixel high
	* Fix for displaying channel & buddy names in conversation window when
	  they have '&' in them
	* Some memory leak fixes, especially in the Text Replacement plugin
	* Rectangular but non-square buddy icons have rounded corners in the buddy
	  list

	Finch:
	* Fix compiling with Glib older than 2.6
	* Ensure existing conversations selected from the 'Send IM' dialog are
	  given focus
	* Move the tooltip on the left of the buddylist if there's not enough room
	  on the right to show it.

version 2.4.0 (02/29/2008):
	http://developer.pidgin.im/query?status=closed&milestone=2.4.0

	libpurple:
	* Added support for offline messages for AIM accounts (thanks to
	  Matthew Goldstein)
	* Fixed various problems with loss of status messages when going
	  or returning from idle on MySpaceIM.
	* Eliminated unmaintained Howl backend implementation for the
	  Bonjour protocol.  Avahi (or Apple's Bonjour runtime on win32) is
	  now required to use Bonjour.
	* Partial support for viewing ICQ status notes (Collin from
	  ComBOTS GmbH).
	* Support for /notice on IRC.
	* Support for Yahoo! Messenger 7.0+ file transfer method (Thanumalayan S.)
	* Support for retrieving full names and addresses from the address book
	  on Yahoo! Japan (Yusuke Odate)
	* The AIM/ICQ server-side preference for "allow others to see me
	  as idle" is no longer unconditionally set to "yes" even when
	  your libpurple preference is "no."
	* Fix SSL certificate checks for renewed certificates
	* Fix the ability to set vCard buddy icons on Google Talk/XMPP
	* D-Bus fixes on 64bit
	* Fixed retrieval of buddy icons and setting of server-side aliases on
	  Yahoo! and Yahoo! Japan when using an HTTP proxy server (Gideon N.
	  Guillen)
	* Fixed an MSN bug that would leave you appearing offline when transferred
	  to different server

	Pidgin:
	* Added the ability to theme conversation name colors (red and blue)
	  through your GTK+ theme, and exposed those theme settings to the
	  Pidgin GTK+ Theme Control plugin (Dustin Howett)
	* Fixed having multiple alias edit areas in the infopane (Elliott Sales
	  de Andrade)
	* Save the conversation "Enable Logging" option per-contact (Moos
	  Heintzen)
	* Typing notifications are now shown in the conversation area

	Finch:
	* Color is used in the buddylist to indicate status, and the conversation
	  window to indicate various message attributes. Look at the sample gntrc
	  file in the man page for details.
	* The default keybinding for dump-screen is now M-D and uses a file
	  request dialog. M-d will properly delete-forward-word, and M-f has been
	  fixed to imitate readline's behavior.
	* New bindings alt+tab and alt+shift+tab to help navigating between the
	  higlighted windows (details on the man page).
	* Recently signed on (or off) buddies blink in the buddy list.
	* New action 'Room List' in the action list can be used to get the list of
	  available chat rooms for an online account.
	* The 'Grouping' plugin can be used for alternate grouping in the
	  buddylist. The current options are 'Group Online/Offline' and 'No
	  Group'.
	* Added a log viewer
	* Added the ability to block/unblock buddies - see the buddy context menu
	  and the menu for the buddy list.
	* Fixed a bug preventing finch working on x86_64

version 2.3.1 (12/7/2007):
	http://developer.pidgin.im/query?status=closed&milestone=2.3.1
		NOTE: Due to the way this release was made, it is possible that
		      bugs marked as fixed in 2.3.1 will not be fixed until the
		      next release.

	* Fixed a number of MSN bugs introduced in 2.3.0, resolving problems
	  connecting to MSN and random local display name changes
	* Going idle on MySpaceIM will no longer clear your status and message.
	* Idle MySpaceIM buddies should now appear online at login.
	* Fixed crashes in XMPP when discovering a client's capabilities
	* Don't set the current tune title if it's NULL (XMPP/Google Talk)
	* Don't allow buddies to be manually added to Bonjour
	* Don't advertise IPv6 on Bonjour because we don't support it
	* Compile fixes for FreeBSD and Solaris
	* Update QQ client version so some accounts can connect again
	* Do not allow ISON requests to stack in IRC, preventing flooding IRC
	  servers when temporary network outages are restored
	* Plug several leaks in the perl plugin loader
	* Prevent autoaccept plugin overwriting existing files

version 2.3.0 (11/24/2007):
	http://developer.pidgin.im/query?status=closed&milestone=2.3.0
		NOTE: Some bugs marked fixed in 2.2.1, 2.2.2 or 2.2.3 may not
		      have been fixed until this release (2.3.0).

	libpurple:
	* Real usernames are now shown in the system log.
	* We now honor a PURPLE_DISABLE_DEPRECATED define to allow plugins to
	  catch deprecated functions earlier rather than later.
	* Thanks to a patch from Intel, the Bonjour prpl now supports file
	  transfers using XEP-0096 and XEP-0065.  This should enable file
	  transfers between libpurple clients and Gajim clients, but will not
	  work with iChat or Adium as they use a different file transfer
	  implementation.
	* XMPP password changes that return errors no longer cause the saved
	  password to be changed.
	* XMPP file transfer support has been enhanced to support sending
	  files through a proxy when the server supports discovering a
	  a bytestream proxy.  This should make file transfers much more
	  reliable.  The next release will add support for manually specifying
	  a proxy when the server doesn't advertise one.

	Pidgin:
	* If a plugin says it can't be unloaded, we now display an error and
	  remove the plugin from the list of saved plugins so it won't load
	  at the next startup.  Previously, we were ignoring this case, which
	  could lead to crashes.
	* Mark dialog windows as transient for appropriate parent windows to
	  help window managers do the right thing  (Gabriel Schulhof)
	* Connection errors are now reported in mini-dialogs inside the buddy
	  list, rather than as buttons in the buddy list and with dialog
	  boxes.  If several accounts are disabled when you sign on elsewhere,
	  you can now re-enable them all with a single click.
	* Added tooltips to the Room List window to show full topics
	* Added buttons in preferences to access GNOME network and browser
	  preferences configuration dialogs when running under GNOME
	* If you alias a buddy to an alias that is already present within
	  a particular group, we now offer to merge the buddies into the
	  same contact.
	* A music emblem is now displayed in the buddy list for a buddy if we
	  know she is listening to some soothing music.
	* Added a 'Move to' menu in buddy list context menu for moving buddies
	  to other groups as an alternative to dragging.
	* Group headings are now marked via an underline instead of a
	  different color background.
	* It is now possible to mark a chat on your buddy list as "Persistent"
	  so you do not leave the chat when the window or tab is closed.
	* The auto-join option for chats is now listed in the "Add Chat"
	  dialog along with the new persistence option.
	* Closing an IM no longer immediately closes your conversation.  It
	  will now remain active for a short time so that if the conversation
	  resumes, the history will be retained.  A preference has been added
	  to toggle this behavior.
	* The "Smiley" menu has been moved to the top-level of the toolbar.
	* Pidgin's display is now saved with the command line for session
	  restoration.  (David Mohr)
	* ICQ Birthday notifications are shown as buddy list emblems.
	* Plugin actions are now available from the docklet context menu
	  in addition to the Tool menu of the buddy list.
	* The manual page has been heavily rewritten to bring it in line
	  with current functionality.

	Finch:
	* If a plugin says it can't be unloaded, we now display an error and
	  remove the plugin from the list of saved plugins so it won't load
	  at the next startup.  Previously, we were ignoring this case, which
	  could lead to crashes.
	* It's possible to bind key-strokes to specific menuitems in the windows.
	  Read the 'Menus' section in the man-page for details.
	* 'transpose-chars' operation for the entry boxes. The default key-binding
	  is ctrl+t.
	* 'yank' operation for the entry boxes. The default binding is ctrl+y.

version 2.2.2 (10/23/2007):
	http://developer.pidgin.im/query?status=closed&milestone=2.2.2
