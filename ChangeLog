version 2.0.0:

	  (Sadrul Habib Chowdhury, Google Summer of Code)

	* The code dealing with buddy and account status, away messages,
	  away states, online/offline, etc has been completely rewritten.
	  Huge thanks to Christian Hammond, Dave West, Daniel Atallah and
	  Sadrul Habib Chowdhury.
	* Your status can now be set from inside the buddy list using the
	  selector at the bottom of the window.
