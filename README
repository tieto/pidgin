Gaim is an IM client that supports many protocols, including AIM, ICQ,
MSN, IRC, and Jabber. Gaim is NOT endorsed by, nor affiliated with,
AOL nor any other company in ANY way.


BUILD
=====

Read the 'INSTALL' file for more detailed directions.

Gaim uses the standard ./configure ; make. You need to use gmake, BSD
make probably won't work. Remember, run ./configure --help to see what
build options are available.

In order to compile Gaim, you need to have GTK+ 2.0 installed (as
well as the development files!). The configure script will fail if you
don't. You can get it from http://www.gtk.org/.

Gaim will try to compile with Gnome features if you have Gnome on your
system. If you don't have them, it will settle for simply GTK. If you
don't want Gnome bits, ./configure --disable-gnome

If you want to build as a GNOME applet:
./configure --enable-panel ; make
then su to root and run "make install".
Afterwards panel->Add applet->Network->Gaim should be there.


RUN
===

You should run 'make install' as root to make sure plugins and other files
get installed into locations they want to be in. Once you've done that,
you only need to run 'gaim'.

To use the other services (such as Yahoo and IRC) which are available
as plugins:

They are installed in $libdir/gaim, which usually is either /usr/lib/gaim
or /usr/local/lib/gaim, and should have a somewhat descriptive name (e.g.
libyahoo.so or libirc.so). Load those plugins using the normal plugin
dialog.  Then in the account editor, add a new account; the Protocol option
menu should now have another option for the protocol that you loaded. Then
you can sign that account on.

Read below for protocol-specific information.


PLUGINS
=======

If you do not wish to enable the plugin support within Gaim, run the
./configure script with the --disable-plugins option and recompile your
source code.  This will prevent the ability to load plugins.

'make install' puts the plugins in $PREFIX/lib/gaim (PREFIX being what
you specified when you ./configure'd - it defaults to /usr/local). Gaim
looks for the plugins in that directory by default, but they do not have
to be there to use them. Also, plugins have a .so extension by default,
though they do not have to.

To build a plugin from a .c file, put it in the plugins/ directory in
the source and run 'make filename.so', e.g. if you have the .c file
'kickass.c', put it in the plugins/ directory, and from that directory,
run 'make kickass.so'.


NOTES
=====

If you manually set a command for your browser or sound player options,
make sure to put double-quotes around the "%s", otherwise bad things may
happen.

If you come across a bug, please report it to http://gaim.sf.net/bug.php.

There always seems to be some iffy-ness by a lot of people about
whether to use the CVS version or stick with a stable release. Use the
CVS version. If you need a version that you know is reliable, then keep
your favorite one in case of an emergency. But for the most part, gaim
is not mission-critical software, and if you can help us find a few bugs
before we release, all the better. (Also, CVS tends to be more stable
than releases, since we get 10 or 12 bug reports right after we make a
release, and all those bugs are fixed within a day or two usually.) Read
http://gaim.sf.net/cvs.php for more information.


PROTOCOL INFORMATION
====================

Each protocol is hacked by both Rob and Eric, though there is one person
that kind of "owns" a protocol (mostly indicating that they were the
person that originally wrote it). Their name will be next to the protocol;
they're the people to complain to when something doesn't work ;).


TOC (Rob)
===

You shouldn't use TOC, you should use Oscar instead. TOC can sync your
buddy list with the server (if it's not too long), and can respond to file
transfer requests (both sending and receiving). Other than that, there's
nothing it can do that Oscar can't, yet. The TOC protocol doesn't allow
retrieval of away messages; isn't capable of sending or receiving buddy
icons; it also can't make file transfer requests.


Oscar (Eric)
=====

Oscar is the default protocol. It is recommended that you use Oscar for
both AIM and ICQ, as TOC isn't very featureful and the old ICQ protocol no
longer works.

For AIM, Oscar can get people's away messages. It can request and accept
Direct IM connections, but it cannot yet transfer files through this (or
through any other means). It can send and receive buddy icons if you have
GdkPixbuf.

For ICQ, it supports nearly everything that the old ICQ plugin supported,
which isn't much. To use Oscar for ICQ, enter your ICQ UIN as the
screenname. The default host/port will work. You'll need to use a different
client to register a new ICQ account if you don't have one yet.


Yahoo (Eric)
=====

Yahoo is currently using the new YMSG protocol that newer official Yahoo
clients are using. This protocol is much better than the old one, and
tends to be somewhat more reliable. However, the Yahoo service is still
flaky at best. Group chats aren't supported yet.


IRC (Eric)
===

There are three ways to join an IRC chat room. The first is the File->Join
A Chat menu option in the Buddy List window. The second is the "Chat"
button at the bottom of the buddy list. The third is to type "/join #name"
in an IM window where the "Send Message As" menu is set to your IRC
account. There are other / commands that work in IM and Chat windows for
IRC, /help will give you a list of them.


MSN (Eric)
===

With MSN you can join a conversation with several people, but you can't
invite people from the IM window yet.


ICQ (Eric)
===

The ICQ plugin is deprecated and will probably be removed soon. The
protocol only marginally works. You should use Oscar for ICQ. You'll
need a different client to register an ICQ account if you don't have
one yet.


Jabber (Eric)
======

Transports aren't currently supported at all, though if you have a
transport already subscribed Gaim will use it (you can't add or remove
transports though). In order to use a server other than jabber.org, set
your username to include the server, e.g. warmenhoven@mycompany.com. This
is the actual format of the Jabber ID anyway; Jabber is email with online
notification. You'll need to use a different client to register a Jabber
account if you don't have one yet.


Napster (Rob)
=======

Heh.  Ok, so I (Rob) am on crack!  Gaim can sign on/off of Napster,
add/remove people to your hotlist (buddylist) as well as chat privately
and in chat rooms.  You can search for files and browse a list of other
user's files.  You can currently download files as long as the person
you're retrieving files from is not firewalled.


Zephyr (Eric)
======

Let me start off by saying how much I really despise Zephyr. They do a
lot of things that make me realize why this never caught on. For those
of you who are unfortunate enough to feel compelling need to use this,
gaim now has a Zephyr plugin. It can currently sign on/off, handles
presence/buddy lists (it even imports your .anyone file!), and can
send/receive personal messages. A lot of stuff is missing, this is just
a real rough first stab at it.


Gadu-Gadu (Eric)
=========

I really shouldn't be taking credit for Gadu-Gadu, I'm just the person who
commits the patches that Arkadiusz Miskiewicz gives me. Gadu-Gadu is an IM
system most similar to ICQ that is quite popular in Poland. It can manage
your server-side buddy list through the Protocol Actions menu. You'll need
to use a different client to register a new account if you don't have one
yet.
