.SH NAME
Pidgin v@VERSION@ \- Instant Messaging client
.SH SYNOPSIS
.TP 5
\fBpidgin \fI[options]\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Pidgin is a modular messaging client capable of using AIM, MSN, Yahoo!, Jabber,
ICQ, IRC, SILC, SIP/SIMPLE Novell GroupWise, Lotus Sametime, Bonjour,
Zephyr, Gadu-Gadu, and QQ all at once.  It has many common features found in
other clients, as well as many unique features.  Pidgin is not endorsed by or
affiliated with America Online, ICQ, Microsoft, or Yahoo.

.SH OPTIONS
The following options are provided by Pidgin using the standard GNU
command line syntax:
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-config=\fIDIR\fB
Use \fIDIR\fR as the directory for config files instead of \fI~/.gaim\fR.
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-debug
Print debugging messages to stdout.  These are the same debugging messages
that are displayed in the \fBDebug Window\fR.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print a summary of command line options and exit.
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-nologin
Don't automatically login when Pidgin starts.  Sets the global status to
\fBOffline\fR.
.TP
.B \-l, \-\-login[=\fINAME\fR,\fINAME\fR,...]
Sign in the comma-separated list of accounts provided, in addition to the
accounts that would be logged in anyway.  If you do not specify such a
comma-separated list, your first account will be signed in.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-version
Print the current version and exit.

.SH BUDDY LIST
The \fBBuddy List\fR window is Pidgin's main interface window.  Using
this window you can see which of your buddies is online, away, idle, etc.
You can also add and remove buddies from your buddy list.

The \fBBuddy List\fR window contains a list of your buddies who are online
and have allowed you to be notified of their presence.  The icon to the
left of each buddy indicates the buddy's current state and the protocol
they are using.  Double clicking a buddy will open a new \fBConversation\fR
window.  Right clicking will pop up a menu:
.TP
.B Get Info
Retrieves and displays information about the buddy.  This information is
also known as a Profile.
.TP
.B IM
Opens a new \fBConversation\fR window to the selected buddy.
.TP
.B Send File
Sends a file to the selected buddy (only available on protocols that support
file transfer).
.TP
.B Add Buddy Pounce
A Buddy Pounce is a configurable automated action to be performed when the
buddy's state changes.  This will open the \fBBuddy Pounce\fR dialog to be
discussed later.
.TP
.B View Log
Pidgin is capable of automatically log its activities.  These logs are
either plain text files (with a .txt extension) or html files (with a
\&.html extension) located under the \fI~/.gaim/logs\fR directory.  This
menu command will display Pidgin's log viewer with logs loaded for that
buddy or chat.
.TP
.B Alias
Create an alias for this buddy.  This will open up a new dialog in which
one can give this buddy an alternate name to appear on the buddy list and
in conversations.

For example, if a buddy's name screen name was jsmith1281xx and his real
name was 'John Q. Smith,' one could create an alias as to identify the
buddy by his common name.
.LP
The remainder of the menu will consist of protocol specific commands.
These commands vary depending on the protocol.
.LP
At the bottom of the \fBBuddy List\fR are several buttons (if enabled in
\fBPreferences\fR):
.TP
.B IM
Opens a new \fBConversation\fR window to to the selected buddy, or brings
up the \fBNew Message\fR dialog box if no buddy is selected.
.TP
.B Info
Retrieves and display information about the selected buddy, or brings up
the \fBGet User Info\fR dialog box if no buddy is selected.
.TP
.B Chat
Brings up the \fBJoin Chat\fR dialog box, prompting the user to select
which username to use and what chat group to join.
.TP
.B Away
Brings up a menu of all available \fBAway Messages\fR.  If an item is
selected, all online accounts will use this item as their away message.

.SH ACCOUNT EDITOR
The account editor consists of a list of accounts and information about
them.  Clicking \fIDelete\fR will delete the currently selected account.
Clicking \fIAdd\fR or \fIModify\fR will invoke a \fBModify Account\fR
window.  Here, you can add or alter account information.  When creating a
new account, you will submit your screen name and password.  You will also
choose your protocol.

If \fIRemember Password\fR is chosen, the password will be saved in
Pidgin's configuration file.

If \fIAuto-Login\fR is chosen, this account will automatically login upon
starting Pidgin.

Each protocol has it's own specific options that can be found in the
modify screen.

plugin, while the \fIDetails\fR field gives the plugin's authorship, URL,
and file name/location information.

Some plugins can be configured.  If you load such a plugin, its
configuration preferences will appear as a submenu to \fBPlugins\fR, with
the submenu title determined by the plugin's name.

.SH Protocols

Protocols provide protocol specific preferences here.

.SH CONVERSATIONS
When starting a new conversation, the user is presented with the
\fBConversation\fR window.  The conversation appears in the upper text box
and the user types his/her message in the lower text box.  Between the two

Most protocols allow for away messages.  When a user is \fIAway\fR, he can
leave an informative message for others to see.  The \fBAway\fR submenu of
the \fBTools\fR menu is used to add and remove away messages.

\fINew Away Message\fR provides space for one to enter an away message and
a title for that message.  If \fISave\fR or \fISave & Use\fR are chosen,
this message will be saved.  It can later be referred to by the title given
to it.

\fIRemove Away Message\fR is a submenu containing the titles of saved away
messages.  Clicking on one of these titles will remove the away message
associated with it.

The rest of the \fIaway\fR menu provides the user with a way to assign
different away messages to different connections.  Choosing \fISet All
Away\fR will set away all the connections capable of the away state.

.SH BUDDY POUNCE
A Buddy Pounce is an automated trigger that occurs when a buddy returns to
a normal state from an away state.  The \fBNew Buddy Pounce\fR dialog box
can be activated by selecting the \fIBuddy Pounce\fR submenu from the
\fBTools\fR menu. A pounce can be set to occur on any combination of the
events listed, and any combination of actions can result.  If \fISave this
pounce after activation\fR is checked, the trigger will remain until it is
removed from the \fIRemove Buddy Pounce\fR menu.

.SH PLUGINS

to Pidgin.  Plugins can be enabled and configured from the
\fBPreferences\fR window.  See \fIplugins/HOWTO\fR for more information on
