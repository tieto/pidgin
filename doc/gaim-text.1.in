\fI~/.gntrc\fR: configuration file for gnt applications.

.TP
A sample file looks like:
.br
[general]
.br
shadow = 0
.br
# There is experimental mouse support
.br
mouse = 1
.br
# To use some custom window-manager
.br
wm = /usr/local/lib/gaim/s.so
.br

.br
[colors]
.br
# The RGB values range in [0, 1000]
.br
black = 0; 0; 0
.br
red = 1000; 0; 0
.br
green = 0; 1000; 0
.br
blue = 250; 250; 700
.br
white = 1000; 1000; 1000
.br
gray = 700; 700; 700
.br
darkgray = 256; 256; 256
.br

.br

.br

.br
highlightd = black; gray
.br
shadow = black; darkgray
.br
title = white; blue
.br

.br
# Remap some keys for GntEntry
.br
[GntEntry::remap]
.br
# Remap the up-arrow to the left-arrow
.br
^[[A = ^[[D
.br
# Remap the down-arrow to the right-arrow
.br
^[[B = ^[[C
.br
# Remap 'a' to 'bcd'
.br
a = bcd
.br
# Completely ignore the key 'q'
.br
q = 
.br
# But the following will NOT work
.br
#abc = bcd
.br

# Hitting 'space' will activate a button
.br
[GntButton::remap]
.br
\\  = \\r
.br

.SH Widget Actions
You can specifiy key-bindings for specific widgets. The following entries in
\fI~/.gntrc\fR correspond to the default keybindings for the actions:

.br
[GntEntry::binding]
.br
c-a = cursor-home
.br
home = cursor-home
.br
c-e = cursor-end
.br
end = cursor-end
.br
backspace = delete-prev
.br
del = delete-next
.br
c-d = delete-next
.br
c-u = delete-start
.br
c-k = delete-end
.br
left = cursor-prev
.br
right = cursor-next
.br
tab = suggest-show
.br
down = suggest-next
.br
up = suggest-prev
.br
# The following actions don't have any default binding:
.br
# delete-prev-word
.br
# cursor-prev-word

.br
[GntTree::binding]
.br
up = move-up
.br
down = move-down
.br
c-n = move-down
.br
c-p = move-up
.br
pageup = page-up
.br
pagedown = page-down
.br

The \fBc-\fR corresponds to the \fBControl\fR key. You can also use \fBctrl-\fR
or \fBctr-\fR or \fBctl-\fR to indicate a combination. For alt-keys, you can use
one of \fBa-\fR, \fBalt-\fR, \fBm-\fR or \fBmeta-\fR. You can also use
\fBhome\fR, \fBend\fR, \fBleft\fR, \fBright\fR etc. keys.

.SH Mouse Support
There is experimental mouse support. You can focus windows, activate buttons,
select rows in a list, scroll using the wheel-scroll etc. Mouse support is
disabled by default, so you need to enable it in ~/.gntrc (see the sample
above).

.SH Window Management
The default window management is very limited. But it is possible to write
custom window managers to suit your needs. There is a sample window-manager
included (named \fIs.so\fR) which adds a little 'close-button' for the windows,
removes the borders from the buddylist and pops up new windows in the middle of
the screen, instead of at the upper-left corder. It is provided as a sample
simple manager, but it should be possible to write more complex managers, and
it's very possible that the window-manager API will need to be enhanced. Look at
the sample ~/.gntrc file above to see how to select a window-manager.


.SH Conversation Commands
There are a few helpful commands in addition to the regular commands. You can
use these from any conversation to access other windows.

.TP
.B accounts
for the accounts window.

.TP
.B buddylist
for the buddylist.

.TP
.B debugwin
for the debug window.

.TP
.B plugins
for the plugins window.

.TP
.B prefs
for the preferences window.

.TP
.B status
for the status window.
