.SH Widget Actions
You can specifiy key-bindings for specific widgets. The following entries in
\fI~/.gntrc\fR correspond to the default keybindings for the actions:

.br
[GntBox::binding]
.br
tab = focus-next
.br
right = focus-next
.br
left = focus-prev

.br
[GntEntry::binding]
.br
c-a = cursor-home
.br
home = cursor-home
.br
c-e = cursor-end
.br
end = cursor-end
.br
backspace = delete-prev
.br
del = delete-next
.br
c-d = delete-next
.br
c-u = delete-start
.br
c-k = delete-end
.br
c-b = cursor-prev
.br
left = cursor-prev
.br
c-f = cursor-next
.br
right = cursor-next
.br
tab = suggest-show
.br
down = suggest-next
.br
up = suggest-prev
.br
c-w = delete-prev-word
.br
a-b = cursor-prev-word
.br
a-f = cursor-next-word
.br
a-d = delete-next-word
.br
c-v = clipboard-paste

.br
[GntTree::binding]
.br
up = move-up
.br
down = move-down
.br
c-n = move-down
.br
c-p = move-up
.br
pageup = page-up
.br
pagedown = page-down
.br
backspace = move-parent
.br
# Following is the default binding for the context-menu
.br
menu = context-menu
.br
# The following will let you open the context-menu in the buddylist with c-b
.br
# c-b = context-menu

.br
[GntWidget::binding]
.br
f11 = context-menu
.br
c-x = context-menu

[GntWindow::binding]
.br
c-o = show-menu
.br
f10 = show-menu

The \fBc-\fR corresponds to the \fBControl\fR key. You can also use \fBctrl-\fR
or \fBctr-\fR or \fBctl-\fR to indicate a combination. For alt-keys, you can use
one of \fBa-\fR, \fBalt-\fR, \fBm-\fR or \fBmeta-\fR. You can also use
\fBhome\fR, \fBend\fR, \fBleft\fR, \fBright\fR etc. keys.

To unbind a key which has a default binding, you simply bind it to the empty string.  For example, to unbind \fBAlt + q\fR from the Quit function, you would use:

[GntWM::binding]
.br
a-q =

.SH Menus
You can also specify key-bindings to trigger specific menuitems in windows. For example, the following entry in \fI~/.gntrc\fR will bind \fBCtrl + t\fR to the 'Send IM...' item in the buddylist:

[buddylist::menu]
.br
c-t = send-im

The following is the list of IDs of the current menuitems in the buddylist:

send-im
.br
join-chat
.br
show-empty-groups
.br
show-offline-buddies
.br
sort-status
.br
sort-alpha
.br
sort-log
.br
add-buddy
.br
add-chat
.br
add-group

.SH Mouse Support
There is experimental mouse support. You can focus windows, activate buttons,
select rows in a list, scroll using the wheel-scroll etc. Selecting text in a
text-view copies it to the gnt clipboard. Mouse support is disabled by default,
so you need to enable it in \fI~/.gntrc\fR (see the sample above).

.SH Window Management
The default window management is very limited. But it is possible to write
custom window managers to suit your needs. There is a sample window-manager
included (named \fIs.so\fR) which adds a little 'close-button' for the windows,
removes the borders from the buddylist and pops up new windows in the middle of
the screen, instead of at the upper-left corder. It is provided as a sample
simple manager, but it should be possible to write more complex managers, and
it's very possible that the window-manager API will need to be enhanced. Look at
the sample \fI~/.gntrc\fR file above to see how to select a window-manager.

It is also possible to rebind the window-manager actions in \fI~/.gntrc\fR, eg:

.br
[GntWM::binding]
.br
a-n = window-next
.br
a-p = window-prev
.br
a-c = window-close
.br
a-w = window-list
.br
a-d = dump-screen
.br
a-, = shift-left
.br
a-. = shift-right
.br
a-a = action-list
.br
a-m = start-move
.br
a-r = start-resize
.br
a-q = wm-quit
.br
a-l = refresh-screen
.br
a-s = workspace-list
.br
a-t = window-tag
.br
a-T = place-tagged
.br
a-C = toggle-clipboard
.br
a-/ = help-for-widget
.br
# The following action is still incomplete, and doesn't have a default binding
.br
# switch-window-n
.br
# Other actions: window-next-urgent, window-prev-urgent

# For the sample custom window manager
.br
[GntS::binding]
.br
a-b = toggle-buddylist

# For the irssi window manager
.br
[Irssi::binding]
.br
a-L = move-right
.br
a-H = move-left
.br
a-J = move-down
.br
a-K = move-up

.SH Conversation Commands
There are a few helpful commands in addition to the regular commands. You can
use these from any conversation to access other windows.

.TP
.B accounts
for the accounts window.

.TP
.B buddylist
for the buddylist.

.TP
.B debugwin
for the debug window.

.TP
